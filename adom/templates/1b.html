    <h1>1 O for a thousand tongues to sing
        my great Redeemer's praise,
        the glories of my God and King,
        the triumphs of his grace!
        2 My gracious Master and my God,
        assist me to proclaim,
        to spread thro' all the earth abroad
        the honors of your name.
        3 Jesus! the name that charms our fears,
        that bids our sorrows cease,
        'tis music in the sinner's ears,
        'tis life and health and peace.
        4 He breaks the power of cancelled sin,
        he sets the prisoner free;
        his blood can make the foulest clean;
        his blood availed for me.
        5 To God all glory, praise, and love
        be now and ever given
        by saints below and saints above,
        the Church in earth and heaven.
        Worship & Rejoice, 2003</h1>
