<p> 1. From Heav'n above to earth I come,
To bear good news to every home;
Glad tidings of great joy I bring,
Whereof I now will say and sing. <br/><br/>2 To you, this night, is born a Child
Of Mary, chosen mother mild;
This tender Child of lowly birth,
Shall be the joy of all your earth. <br> <br> 3 'Tis Christ our God, who far on high
Had heard your sad and bitter cry;
Himself will your Salvation be,
Himself from sin will make you free. <br> <br> 4 He brings those blessings long ago
Prepared by God for all below;
That in His heavenly kingdom blest
You may with us forever rest. <br> <br> 5 These are the tokens ye shall mark,
The swaddling clothes and manger dark;
There shall ye find the young Child laid,
By Whom the heavens and earth were
[made. <br> <br> 6 Now let us all, with gladsome cheer,
Follow the shepherds, and draw near
To see this wondrous Gift of God,
Who hath His own dear Son bestowed. <br> <br> 7 Ah, Lord, who hast created all,
How hast Thou made Thee weak and
[small,
To lie upon the coarse dry grass,
The food of humble ox and ass. <br> <br> 8 Thus hath it pleased Thee to make plain
The truth to us, poor fools and vain,
That this world's honor, wealth and might
Are naught and worthless in Thy sight. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string -->
