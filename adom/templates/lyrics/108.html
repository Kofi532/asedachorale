<p> 1. While shepherds watched their
[flocks by night,
All seated on the ground,
The angel of the Lord came down,
And glory shone around. <br/><br/>2 â€œFear not,â€ said he, for mighty
[dread
Had seized their troubled mind,
â€œGlad tidings of great joy I bring
To you and all mankind.â€ <br> <br> 3 â€œTo you, in David's town this day,
Is born of David's line
The Savior who is Christ the Lord,
And this shall be the sign: <br> <br> 4 The heavenly Babe you there shall
[find
To human view displayed,
All meanly wrapped in swaddling
[bands,
And in a manger laid.â€ <br> <br> 5 Thus spake the Seraph, and forthwith
Appeared a shining throng,
Of angels praising God and thus
Addressed their joyful song: <br> <br> 6 â€œAll glory be to God on high
And on the earth be peace,
Goodwill henceforth from heaven to
[men
Begin and never cease.â€ <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string -->
