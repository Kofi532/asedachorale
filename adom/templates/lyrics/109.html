<p><br/>1 Jesus, Thou joy of loving hearts, <br/> Thou fount of life, Thou light of men, <br/> from the best bliss that earth imparts, <br/> we turn unfilled to Thee again. <br/> <br/>2 Thy truth unchanged hath ever stood; <br/> Thou savest those that on Thee call; <br/> to them that seek Thee, Thou art good, <br/> to them that find Thee all in all. <br/> <br/>3 We taste Thee, O Thou living Bread, <br/> and long to feast upon Thee still; <br/> we drink of Thee, the Fountain-head, <br/> and thirst our souls from Thee to fill. <br/> <br/>4 Our restless spirits yearn for Thee, <br/> where'er our changeful lot is cast; <br/> glad when Thy gracious smile we see, <br/> blest when our faith can hold Thee fast. <br/> <br/>5 O Jesus, ever with us stay, <br/> make all our moments calm and bright; <br/> chase the dark night of sin away; <br/> shed o'er the world Thy holy light. <br/> <br/> Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God #<br/>384</p>
