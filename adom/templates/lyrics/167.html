        <p><br>1 Fierce raged the tempest, oÂer the deep, <br> anxious disciples watch did keep; <br> but you were wrapped in guileless sleep, <br> calm and still. <br> <br>2 ÂSave, us, we perish!Â was their cry. <br> ÂSave us or we will surely die!Â <br> Your word above the storm rose high: <br> ÂPeace! be still.Â <br> <br>3 The wild winds hushed; the angry deep <br> fell, like a little child, to sleep; <br> the sullen billows ceased to leap, <br> at your will. <br> <br>4 So, when our life is clouded oÂer, <br> and storm-winds drift us from the shore, <br> say, lest we sink to rise no more, <br> ÂPeace! be still.Â <br>  <br> Source: Voices Together #<br>286</p>
