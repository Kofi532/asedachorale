He arose! Hallelujah! Christ arose! <br> <br>2 Vainly they watch his bed, Jesus my Savior, <br> vainly they seal the dead, Jesus my Lord! [Refrain] <br> <br>3 Death cannot keep its prey, Jesus my Savior; <br> he tore the bars away, Jesus my Lord! [Refrain] <br> United Methodist Hymnal, <br>1989</p>
