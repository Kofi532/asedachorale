[Refrain] <br> <br>3 Source of all things living, <br> you came down to die, <br> plumbed the depths of hell <br> to raise us up on high. <br> Come, then, true and faithful, <br> come fulfill your word; <br> this is our third morningÂ <br> rise, O buried Lord. [Refrain] <br> <br>4 Free the souls long prisoned, <br> bound with Satan's chain; <br> all that now is fallen <br> raise to life again. <br> Show your face in brightness; <br> shine in ev'ry land <br> as in Eden's garden <br> when the world began.
