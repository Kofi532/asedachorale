        <p><br><br>1. Eternal Sun of righteousness, <br> Display Thy beams divine, <br> And cause the glory of Thy face <br> Upon my heart to shine. <br> <br><br>2. Light, in Thy light, oh, may I see, <br> Thy grace and mercy prove, <br> Revived, and cheered, and blest by Thee, <br> The God of pardoning love. <br> <br><br>3. Lift up Thy countenance serene, <br> And let Thy happy child <br> Behold, without a cloud between, <br> The Father reconciled. <br> <br><br>4. On me Thy promised grace bestow, <br> The peace by Jesus givn; <br> The joys of holiness below, <br> And then the joys of Heavn. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br><br>1377</p>
