<p> 1. Holy, Holy, Holy! Lord God Almighty!
Early in the morning our song shall rise
[to Thee;
Holy, Holy, Holy! Merciful and Mighty!
God in Three Persons, blessed Trinity! <br/><br/>2 Holy, Holy, Holy! all the saints adore Thee,
Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;
Cherubim and Seraphim falling down before Thee,
Which wert, and art, and evermore shalt be. <br> <br> 3 Holy, Holy, Holy! though the darkness hide Thee,
Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see:
Only Thou art Holy, there is none beside Thee,
Perfect in power, in love, and purity. <br> <br> 4 Holy, Holy, Holy! Lord God Almighty!
All Thy works shall praise thy name in earth and sky and sea;
Holy, Holy, Holy! Merciful and Mighty!
God in Three Persons, blessed Trinity! <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string -->
