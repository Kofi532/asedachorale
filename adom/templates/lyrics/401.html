        <p><br>1 Gods trumpet wakes the slumbring world, <br> Now each man to his post! <br> The red-cross banner is unfurled <br> Who join the glorious host? <br> He who is fealty to the truth, <br> And counting all the cost, <br> Doth consecrate his genrous youth, <br> He joins the noble host. <br> <br>2 He who, no anger on his tongue, <br> Nor any idle boast, <br> Bears steadfast witness gainst the wrong, <br> He joins the sacred host. <br> He who, with calm, undaunted will, <br> Neer counts the battle lost, <br> But, tho defeated, battles still, <br> He joins the faithful host. <br> <br>3 He who is ready for the cross, <br> The cause despised loves most, <br> And shuns not pain, or shame, or loss, <br> He joins the martyr-host. <br> Gods trumpet wakes the slumbring world, <br> Now each man to his post! <br> The red-cross banner is unfurled; <br> We join the glorious host. <br>  <br> Source: Williston Hymns #<br>36</p>
