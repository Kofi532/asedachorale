[Refrain] <br> <br>3 Faith of the martyrs, we will love <br> both friend and foe in all our strife, <br> and preach thee, too, as love knows how, <br> by saving word and faithful life! [Refrain] <br> *Alternate phrases: Faith of our fathers or Faith of our mothers <br>  <br> Source: Voices Together #<br>575</p>
