<p><b>P.H.B {{ clicked_value }} </b></p>
<p> 1. Good portion I have in the Lord,
Who made all things we have on earth.
He cares for me, my gracious God,
To Him I yield my life, my all. <br/><br/>2 He is my life and salvation,
My Rock and fortress is the Lord.
My strength and helper in this life,
On Him I must depend in life. <br> <br> 3 The Lord says to all that know Him,
All that, belong and trust in Him.
â€œCall on me in the troubled day,
And I will come deliver youâ€. <br> <br> 4 The Lord shall save you from distress,
And He will glorify His own.
Life in all fullness He will give,
With great salvation, He will bless. <br> <br> 5 Great is the Name of Jehovah,
Great is the praise your Name deserves.
Grant nations to acknowledge you,
Bring all into your Kingdom, Lord. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string -->
