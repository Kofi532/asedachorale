        <p><br>1 Omnipotent Lord, my Saviour and King, <br> Thy succour afford, thy righteousness bring. <br> Thy promises bind thee compassion to have; <br> Now, now let me find thee almighty to save. <br> <br>2 Lord, thou art my hope; oerwhelmèd with grief, <br> To thee I look up for certain relief; <br> I dread no denial, no danger I fear, <br> Nor start from the trial if Jesus be here. <br> <br>3 Yes! God is above men, devils, and sin; <br> My Jesuss love the battle shall win; <br> So terribly glorious his coming shall be, <br> His love all victorious shall conquer for me. <br>  <br> Source: A Selection of Hymns for Public Worship.
