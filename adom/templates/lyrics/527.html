        <p><br>1 Sometimes a light surprises <br> the Christian while he sings; <br> it is the Lord who rises <br> with healing in His wings; <br> when comforts are declining, <br> He grants the soul again <br> a season of clear shining, <br> to cheer it after rain. <br> <br>2 In holy contemplation, <br> we sweetly then pursue <br> the theme of GodÂs salvation, <br> and find it ever new. <br> Set free from present sorrow, <br> we cheerfully can say, <br> ÂE'en let the unknown morrow <br> bring with it what it may.Â <br> <br>3 "It can bring with it nothing, <br> but He will bear us through; <br> who gives the lilies clothing <br> will clothe His people, too; <br> beneath the spreading heavens <br> no creature but is fed; <br> and He who feeds the ravens <br> will give His children bread." <br> <br>4 Though vine nor fig tree neither <br> their wonted fruit should bear, <br> though all the field should wither, <br> nor flocks nor herds be there, <br> yet God the same abiding, <br> His praise shall tune my voice; <br> for while in Him confiding, <br> I cannot but rejoice. <br>  <br> Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God #<br>401</p>
