        <p><br>1 What a friend we have in Jesus, <br> all our sins and griefs to bear! <br> What a privilege to carry <br> everything to God in prayer! <br> O what peace we often forfeit, <br> O what needless pain we bear, <br> all because we do not carry <br> everything to God in prayer! <br> <br>2 Have we trials and temptations? <br> Is there trouble anywhere? <br> We should never be discouraged; <br> take it to the Lord in prayer! <br> Can we find a friend so faithful <br> who will all our sorrows share? <br> Jesus knows our every weakness; <br> take it to the Lord in prayer! <br> <br>3 Are we weak and heavy laden, <br> cumbered with a load of care? <br> Precious Savior, still our refuge-- <br> take it to the Lord in prayer! <br> Do your friends despise, forsake you? <br> Take it to the Lord in prayer! <br> In his arms he'll take and shield you; <br> you will find a solace there. <br> Worship and Rejoice, <br>2003</p>
