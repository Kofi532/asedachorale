        <p><br>1 Lord God, by whom all change is wrought, <br> By whom new things to birth are brought, <br> In whom no change is known! <br> Whate'er Thou dost, whate'er Thou art, <br> Thy people still in Thee have part; <br> Still, still Thou art our own. <br> <br>2 Ancient of Days! we dwell in Thee; <br> Out of Thine own eternity <br> Our peace and joy are wrought <br> We rest in our eternal God, <br> And make secure and sweet abode <br> With Thee, who changest not. <br> <br>3 Each steadfast promise we possess; <br> Thine everlasting truth we bless, <br> Thine everlasting love, <br> The unfailing Helper close we clasp, <br> The everlasting Arms we grasp, <br> Nor from the Refuge move. <br> <br>4 Spirit who makest all things new, <br> Thou leadest onward; we pursue <br> The heavenly march sublime, <br> 'Neath Thy renewing fire we glow, <br> And still from strength to strength we go, <br> From height to height we climb. <br> <br>5 Darkness and dread we leave behind, <br> New light, new glory still we find, <br> New realms divine possess; <br> New births of grace new raptures bring; <br> Triumphant, the new song we sing, <br> The great Renewer bless. <br> <br>6 To Thee we rise, in Thee we rest; <br> We stay at home, we go in quest, <br> Still Thou art our abode <br> The rapture swells, the wonder grows <br> As full on us new life still flows <br> From our unchanging God. <br>  <br> Source: Methodist Hymn and Tune Book: official hymn book of the Methodist Church #<br>55a</p>
