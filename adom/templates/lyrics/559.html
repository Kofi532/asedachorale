Come, O my God, the promise seal, <br> This mountain, sin, remove; <br> Now in my waiting soul reveal <br> The virtue of thy love. <br> Send sanctifying power, Lord, <br> Come quickly from above; <br> Burn out the dross of base desire, <br> Fill me with perfect love. <br> <br>2. I want Thy life, Thy purity, <br> Thy righteousness, brought in; <br> I ask, desire, and trust in Thee, <br> To be redeemed from sin. <br> Send sanctifying power, Lord, <br> Come quickly from above; <br> Burn out the dross of base desire, <br> Fill me with perfect love. <br> <br>3. Saviour, to thee my soul looks up, <br> My present Saviour Thou! <br> In all the confidence of hope, <br> I claim the blessing now. <br> Send sanctifying power, Lord, <br> Come quickly from above; <br> Burn out the dross of base desire, <br> Fill me with perfect love. <br> <br>4. Â‘Tis done! Thou dost this moment save, <br> With full salvation bless; <br> Redemption through thy blood I have, <br> And spotless love and peace. <br> O hallelujah! praise His name, <br> He doth my soul release; <br> Redemption through Thy blood I have, <br> And spotless love and peace. <br>  <br> Source: Hymns of the Kingdom: for use in religious meetings #<br>39</p>
