        <p><br>1 Blessed are the pure in heart, <br> They have loved the better part; <br> When lifes journey they have trod, <br> They shall go to see their God. <br> Till in glory they appear, <br> They shall often see Him here; <br> And His grace shall learn to know <br> In His glorious works below. <br> <br>2 When the sun begins to rise, <br> Spreading brightness through the skies, <br> They will love to praise and bless <br> Christ, the Son of Righteousness. <br> In the watches of the night, <br> When the stars are clear and bright, <br> Thus the just shall shine they say, <br> In the Resurrection day. <br> <br>3 When the leaves in autumn die, <br> Falling fast and silently, <br> These, they thing, that now seem dead, <br> Shall in spring lift up their head. <br> God in every thing they see; <br> First in all their thoughts is He; <br> They have loved the better part; <br> Blessed are the pure in heart! <br>  <br> Source: The Sunday School Hymnal: with offices of devotion #<br>208</p>
