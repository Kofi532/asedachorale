        <p><br>1 Stay, Master, stay upon this heavenly hill; <br> A little longer, let us linger still; <br> With all the mighty ones of old beside, <br> Near to Gods holy presence still abide; <br> Before the throne of light we trembling stand, <br> And catch a glimpse into the spirit land. <br> <br>2 Stay, Master, stay! we breathe a purer air; <br> This life is not the life that waits us there: <br> Thoughts, feelings, flashes, glimpses come and go; <br> We cannot speak them, nay, we do not know; <br> Wrapt in this cloud of light we seem to be <br> The things we fain would grow eternally. <br> <br>3 "No!" saith the Lord, "the hour is past," we go; <br> Our home, our life, our duties lie below. <br> While here we kneel upon the mount of prayer, <br> The plough lies waiting in the furrow there! <br> Here we sought God that we might know His will; <br> There we must do it, serve Him, seek Him still. <br> <br>4 If man aspires to reach the throne of God, <br> Oer the dull plains of earth must lie the road: <br> He who best does his lowly duty here, <br> Shall mount the highest in a nobler sphere: <br> At Gods own feet our spirits seek their rest, <br> And he is nearest Him who serves Him best. <br>  <br> Source: African Methodist Episcopal Church Hymnal #<br>127</p>
