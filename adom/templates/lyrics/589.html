        <p><br>1 Go, labor on; spend, and be spent, <br> thy joy to do the Father's will; <br> it is the way the Master went; <br> should not the servant tread it still? <br> <br>2 Go, labor on; 'tis not for naught; <br> thine earthly loss is heav'nly gain; <br> men heed thee, love thee, praise thee not; <br> the Master praises- what are men? <br> <br>3 Go, labor on; enough while here <br> if He shall praise thee, if He deign <br> thy willing heart to mark and cheer; <br> no toil for Him shall be in vain. <br> <br>4 Go, labor on while it is day: <br> the world's dark night is hast'ning on. <br> Speed, speed thy work, cast sloth away; <br> It is not thus that souls are won. <br> <br>5 Toil on, faint not, keep watch and pray; <br> be wise the erring soul to win; <br> go forth into the world's highway, <br> compel the wand'rer to come in. <br> <br>6 Toil on, and in thy toil rejoice; <br> for toil comes rest, for exile home; <br> soon shalt thou hear the Bridegroom's voice, <br> the midnight peal, "Behold, I come." <br>  <br> Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God #<br>396</p>
