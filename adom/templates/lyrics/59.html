        <p><br>1. Good Thou art, and good Thou dost, <br> Thy mercies reach to all, <br> Chiefly those who on Thee trust, <br> And for Thy mercy call; <br> New they every morning are; <br> As fathers when their children cry, <br> Us Thou dost in pity spare, <br> And all our wants supply. <br> <br>2. Mercy o'er Thy works presides; <br> Thy providence displayed <br> Still preserves, and still provides <br> For all Thy hands have made; <br> Keeps, with most distinguished care, <br> The man who on Thy love depends; <br> Watches every numbered hair, <br> And all his steps attends. <br> <br>3. Who can sound the depths unknown <br> Of Thy redeeming grace? <br> Grace that gave Thine only Son <br> To save a ruined race! <br> Millions of transgressors poor <br> Thou hast for Jesus' sake forgiven, <br> Made them of Thy favor sure, <br> And snatched from hell to Heaven. <br> <br>4. Millions more Thou ready art <br> To save, and to forgive; <br> Every soul and every heart <br> Of man Thou wouldst receive: <br> Father, now accept of mine, <br> Which now, through Christ, I offer Thee; <br> Tell me now, in love divine, <br> That Thou hast pardoned me! <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>1976</p>
