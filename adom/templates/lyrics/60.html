        <p><br>1. Ere God had built the mountains, <br> Or raised the fruitful hills; <br> Before He filled the fountains <br> That feed the running rills; <br> In me from everlasting, <br> The wonderful I Am, <br> Found pleasures never wasting, <br> And Wisdom is my name. <br> <br>2. When, like a tent to dwell in, <br> He spread the skies abroad, <br> And swathed about the swelling <br> Of OceanÃÂs mighty flood; <br> He wrought by weight and measure, <br> And I was with Him then: <br> Myself the FatherÃÂs pleasure, <br> And mine, the sons of men. <br> <br>3. Thus WisdomÃÂs words discover <br> Thy glory and Thy grace, <br> Thou everlasting Lover <br> Of our unworthy race! <br> Thy gracious eye surveyed us <br> Ere stars were seen above; <br> In wisdom Thou hast made us, <br> And died for us in love. <br> <br>4. And couldst Thou be delighted <br> With creatures such as we, <br> Who, when we saw Thee, slighted, <br> And nailed Thee to a tree? <br> Unfathomable wonder, <br> And mystery divine! <br> The voice that speaks in thunder, <br> Says, Sinner, I am thine! <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>1354</p>
