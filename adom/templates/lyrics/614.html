        <p><br>1 Heavenly Father, You have brought us <br> safely to the present day, <br> gently leading on our footsteps, <br> watching oer us all the way. <br> Friend and guide through lifes long journey, <br> grateful hearts to You we bring; <br> but for love so true and changeless <br> how shall we fit praises sing? <br> <br>2 Mercies new and never-failing <br> brightly shine through all the past, <br> watchful care and loving-kindness <br> always near from first to last, <br> tender love, divine protection <br> ever with us day and night; <br> blessings more than we can number <br> strew the path with golden light. <br> <br>3 Shadows deep have crossed our pathway, <br> we have trembled in the storm; <br> clouds have gathered round so darkly <br> that we could not see Your form; <br> yet Your love has never left us <br> in our griefs to be alone, <br> and the help each gave the other <br> was the strength that is Your own. <br> <br>4 Many that we loved have left us, <br> reaching first their journeys end; <br> now they wait to give us welcome, <br> brother, sister, child, and friend. <br> When at last our journeys over, <br> and we pass away from sight, <br> Father, take us through the darkness <br> into everlasting light. <br>  <br> Source: The Irish Presbyterian Hymbook #<br>133</p>
