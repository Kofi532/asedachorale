        <p><br>1 O love, how deep, how broad, how high, <br> how passing thought and fantasy, <br> that God, the Son of God, should take <br> our mortal form for mortals' sake! <br> <br>2 He sent no angel to our race, <br> of higher or of lower place, <br> but wore the robe of human frame, <br> and He Himself to this world came. <br> <br>3 For us baptized, for us He bore <br> His holy fast, and hungered sore; <br> for us temptations sharp He knew, <br> for us the tempter overthrew. <br> <br>4 For us to wicked men betrayed, <br> scourged, mocked, in crown of thorns arrayed, <br> He bore the shameful cross and death <br> for us at length gave up His breath. <br> <br>5 For us He rose from death again, <br> for us He went on high to reign, <br> for us He sent His Spirit here <br> to guide, to strengthen, and to cheer. <br> <br>6 All glory to our Lord and God <br> for love so deep, so high, so broadÃÂ <br> the Trinity whom we adore <br> forever and forevermore. <br>  <br> Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God #<br>258</p>
