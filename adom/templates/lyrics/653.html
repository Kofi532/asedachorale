        <p><br>1. Sweet place; sweet place alone! <br> The court of God most high, <br> The heaven of heavens, the throne <br> Of spotless majesty! <br> Refrain <br> O happy place! <br> When shall I be, my God, with Thee, <br> To see Thy face? <br> <br>2. The stranger homeward bends, <br> And sigheth for his rest: <br> Heaven is my home, my friends <br> Lodge there in Abrahams breast. [Refrain] <br> <br>3. Earths but a sorry tent, <br> Pitched but a few frail days, <br> A short leased tenement; <br> Heavens still my song, my praise. [Refrain] <br> <br>4. No tears from any eyes <br> Drop in that holy choir: <br> But death itself there dies, <br> And sighs themselves expire. [Refrain] <br> <br>5. There should temptations cease, <br> My frailties there should end. <br> There should I rest in peace <br> In the arms of my best friend. [Refrain] <br> <br>6. Jerusalem on high <br> My song and city is, <br> My home wheneer I die, <br> The center of my bliss. [Refrain] <br> <br>7. Thy walls, sweet city! thine <br> With pearls are garnished, <br> Thy gates with praises shine, <br> Thy streets with gold are spread. [Refrain] <br> <br>8. No sun by day shines there, <br> No moon by silent night. <br> O no! these needless are; <br> The Lambs the citys light. [Refrain] <br> <br>9. There dwells my Lord, my king, <br> Judged here unfit to live; <br> There angels to Him sing, <br> And lowly homage give. [Refrain] <br> <br>10. The patriarchs of old <br> There from their travels cease: <br> The prophets there behold <br> Their longed for Prince of Peace. [Refrain] <br> <br>11. The Lambs apostles there <br> I might with joy behold: <br> The harpers I might hear <br> Harping on harps of gold. [Refrain] <br> <br>12. The bleeding martyrs, they <br> Within those courts are found; <br> All clothed in pure array, <br> Their scars with glory crowned. [Refrain] <br> <br>13. Ah me! ah me! that I <br> In Kedars tents here stay; <br> No place like this on high; <br> Thither, Lord! guide my way. [Refrain] <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>6421</p>
