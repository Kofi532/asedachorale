        <p><br>1 O Love Divine! whose constant beam <br> Shines on the eyes that will not see, <br> And waits to bless us, while we dream, <br> Thou leavest us because we turn from Thee! <br> <br>2 All souls that struggle and aspire, <br> All hearts of prayer by Thee are lit; <br> And, dim or clear, Thy tongues of fire <br> On dusky tribes and twilight centuries sit. <br> <br>3 Nor bounds, nor clime, nor creed Thou know'st, <br> Wide as our need Thy favours fall; <br> The white wings of the Holy Ghost <br> Stoop, seen or unseen, o'er the heads of all. <br> <br>4 O Beauty, old yet ever new! <br> Eternal Voice, and Inward Word, <br> The Logos of the Greek and Jew, <br> The old-sphere music which the Samian heard! <br> <br>5 Truth which the sage and prophet saw, <br> Long sought without, but found within, <br> The Law of Love, beyond all law, <br> The Life o'erflooding mortal death and sin! <br> <br>6 Shine on us with the light which glowed <br> Upon the trance-bound shepherd's way; <br> Who saw the darkness overflowed, <br> And drowned by tides of everlasting day. <br> <br>7 Shine, Light of God! make broad Thy scope <br> To all who sin and suffer; more <br> And better than we dare to hope, <br> With heaven's compassion make our longings poor! <br>  <br> Source: Methodist Hymn and Tune Book: official hymn book of the Methodist Church #<br>162</p>
