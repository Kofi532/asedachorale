        <p><br>1 Great is the LORD, our God, <br> and let His praise be great; <br> He makes His churches His abode, <br> His most delightful seat. <br> These temples of His grace, <br> how beautiful they stand, <br> the honors of our native place <br> and bulwarks of our land! <br> <br>2 Oft have our fathers told, <br> our eyes have often seen, <br> how well our God secures the fold <br> where His own sheep have been. <br> In ev'ry new distress <br> weÂ’ll to His house repair, <br> recall to mind His wondrous grace, <br> and seek deliv'rance there. <br> <br>3 Far as Thy Name is known, <br> the world declares Thy praise; <br> Thy saints, O LORD, before Thy throne, <br> their songs of honor raise. <br> With joy Thy people stand <br> on Zion's chosen hill, <br> proclaim the wonders of Thy hand, <br> and councils of Thy will. <br> <br>4 How decent and how wise! <br> How glorious to behold! <br> Beyond the pomp that charms the eyes, <br> and rites adorned with gold. <br> The God we worship now <br> will guide us till we die; <br> will be our God while here below, <br> and ours above the sky. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Hymns to the Living God #<br>42</p>
