        <p><br>1 NONE is like JeshurunÃÂs God, <br> So great, so strong, so high; <br> Lo! He spreads His wings abroad, <br> He rides upon the sky: <br> Israel is His first-born son; <br> God, thÃÂalmighty God, is thine; <br> See Him to Thy help come down, <br> The excellence divine.<br>2 Thee the great Jehovah deigns <br> To succour and defend; <br> Thee the eternal God sustains, <br> Thy Maker and thy Friend: <br> Israel, what hast thou to dread? <br> Safe from all impending harms, <br> Round thee and beneath are spread <br> The everlasting arms.<br>3 In a land of corn and wine <br> His lot shall be below; <br> Comforts there, and blessings join, <br> And milk and honey flow; <br> JacobÃÂs well is in his soul: <br> Gracious dew his heavens distil, <br> Fill his soul, already full, <br> And shall for ever fill.<br>4 Blest, O Israel art Thou! <br> What people is like thee? <br> Saved from sin by Jesus, now <br> Thou art and still shalt be; <br> Jesus is thy sevenfold shield, <br> Jesus is thy flaming sword; <br> Earth, and hell, and sin shall yield <br> To GodÃÂs almighty Word. <br>  <br> Source: Redemption Hymnal #<br>118</p>
