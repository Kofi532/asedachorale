        <p><br>1 Blest are the humble souls that see <br> their emptiness and poverty; <br> treasures of grace to them are giv'n, <br> and crowns of joy laid up in heav'n. <br> <br>2 Blest are the men of broken heart, <br> who mourn for sin with inward smart; <br> the blood of Christ divinely flows, <br> a healing balm for all their woes. <br> <br>3 Blest are the meek, who stand afar <br> from rage and passion, noise and war; <br> God will secure their happy state, <br> and plead their cause against the great. <br> <br>4 Blest are the souls that thirst for grace, <br> hunger and long for righteousness; <br> they shall be well supplied and fed, <br> with living streams and living bread. <br> <br>5 Blest are the men whose hearts do move <br> and melt with sympathy and love; <br> from Christ the Lord shall they obtain <br> like sympathy and love again. <br> <br>6 Blest are the pure, whose hearts are clean <br> from the defiling pow'rs of sin; <br> with endless pleasure they shall see <br> a God of spotless purity. <br> <br>7 Blest are the men of peaceful life, <br> who quench the coals of growing strife; <br> they shall be called the heirs of bliss, <br> the sons of God, the God of peace. <br> <br>8 Blest are the suff'rers who partake <br> of pain and shame for Jesus' sake; <br> their souls shall triumph in the Lord, <br> glory and joy are their reward. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Trinity Psalter Hymnal #<br>464</p>
