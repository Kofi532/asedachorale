        <p><br>1 Brethren in Christ, and well-beloved, <br> To Jesus and His servants dear, <br> Enter and show yourselves approved; <br> Enter, and find that God is here. <br> <br>2 Welcome from earth: lo, the right hand <br> Of fellowship to you we give! <br> With open hearts and hands we stand, <br> And you in Jesus name receive. <br> <br>3 Say, are your hearts resolved as ours? <br> Then let them burn with sacred love; <br> Then let them taste the heavenly powers, <br> Partakers of the joys above. <br> <br>4 Jesu, attend, Thyself reveal! <br> Are we not met in Thy great name? <br> Thee in the midst we wait to feel, <br> We wait to catch the spreading flame. <br> <br>5 Thou God that answerest by fire, <br> The Spirit of burning now impart; <br> And let the flames of pure desire <br> Rise from the altar of our heart. <br> <br>6 Truly our fellowship below <br> With Thee and with the Father is; <br> In Thee eternal life we know, <br> And Heavens unutterable bliss. <br> <br>7 In part we only know Thee here, <br> But wait Thy coming from above; <br> And we shall then behold Thee near, <br> And we shall all be lost in love. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>11493</p>
