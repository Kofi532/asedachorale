        <p><br>1 My God, how wonderful Thou art, <br> Thy majesty how bright, <br> How beautiful Thy mercy seat, <br> in depths of burning light! <br> <br>2 How dread are Thine eternal years, <br> O everlasting LORD; <br> by prostrate spirits, day and night, <br> incessantly adored. <br> <br>3 How wonderful, how beautiful, <br> the sight of Thee must be, <br> Thine endless wisdom, boundless pow'r, <br> and awful purity. <br> <br>4 O how I fear Thee, Living God, <br> with deepest, tend'rest fears, <br> and worship Thee with trembling hope, <br> and penitential tears. <br> <br>5 Yet I may love Thee too, O LORD, <br> Almighty as Thou art; <br> for Thou hast stooped to ask of me <br> the love of my poor heart. <br> <br>6 No earthly father loves like Thee, <br> no mother e'er so mild, <br> bears and forbears, as Thou hast done <br> with me, Thy sinful child. <br> <br>7 Father of Jesus, love's reward, <br> what rapture will it be, <br> prostrate before Thy throne to lie, <br> and ever gaze on Thee! <br>  <br> Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God #<br>163</p>
