        <p><br>1 Father of everlasting grace, <br> thy goodness and thy truth we praise, <br> thy goodness and thy truth we prove; <br> thou hast, in honor of thy Son, <br> the gift unspeakable sent down, <br> the Spirit of life, and power and love. <br> <br>2 Send us the Spirit of thy Son, <br> to make the depths of Godhead known, <br> to make us share the life divine; <br> send him the sprinkled blood to apply, <br> send him our souls to sanctify, <br> and show and seal us ever thine. <br> <br>3 So shall we pray, and never cease, <br> so shall we thankfully confess <br> thy wisdom, truth, and power, and love; <br> with joy unspeakable adore, <br> and bless and praise thee evermore, <br> and serve thee as thy hosts above: <br> <br>4 Till, added to that heavenly choir, <br> we raise our songs of triumph higher, <br> and praise thee in a bolder strain, <br> out-soar the first-born seraphÂ’s flight, <br> and sing, with all our friends in light, <br> thy everlasting love to man. <br>  <br> Source: Common Praise: A new edition of Hymns Ancient and Modern #<br>420</p>
