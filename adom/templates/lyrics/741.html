        <p><br>1 We have not known thee as we ought, <br> nor learned thy wisdom, grace and pow'r; <br> the things of earth have filled our thought, <br> and trifles of the passing hour. <br> Lord, give us light thy truth to see, <br> and make us wise in knowing thee. <br> <br>2 We have not feared thee as we ought, <br> nor bowed beneath thine awesome eye, <br> nor guarded deed and word and thought, <br> remembering that God was nigh. <br> Lord, give us faith to know thee near, <br> and grant the grace of holy fear. <br> <br>3 We have not loved thee as we ought, <br> nor cared that we are loved by thee; <br> thy presence we have coldly sought, <br> and feebly longed thy face to see. <br> Lord, give a pure and loving heart <br> to feel and own the love thou art. <br> <br>4 We have not served thee as we ought; <br> alas! the duties left undone, <br> the work with little fervor wrought, <br> the battles lost or scarcely won! <br> Lord, give the zeal and give the might, <br> for thee to toil, for thee to fight. <br> <br>5 When shall we know thee as we ought, <br> and fear and love and serve aright! <br> When shall we, out of trial brought, <br> be perfect in the land of light! <br> Lord, may we day by day prepare <br> to see thy face and serve thee there. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Trinity Psalter Hymnal #<br>178</p>
