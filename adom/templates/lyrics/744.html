        <p><br>1 O happy day that fixed my choice <br> On Thee, my Savior and my God! <br> Well may this glowing heart rejoice, <br> And tell its raptures all abroad. <br> Refrain: <br> Happy day, happy day, <br> When Jesus washed my sins away! <br> He taught me how to watch and pray, <br> And live rejoicing every day; <br> Happy day, happy day, <br> When Jesus washed my sins away! <br> <br>2 O happy bond, that seals my vows <br> To Him who merits all my love! <br> Let cheerful anthems fill His house, <br> While to that sacred shrine I move. [Refrain] <br> <br>3 'Tis done, the great transaction's done; <br> I am my Lord's and He is mine; <br> He drew me and I followed on, <br> Rejoiced to own the call divine. [Refrain] <br> <br>4 Now rest, my long-divided heart, <br> Fixed on this blissful center, rest; <br> Here have I found a nobler part, <br> Here heavenly pleasures fill my breast. [Refrain] <br> <br>5 High heaven that hears the solemn vow, <br> That vow renewed shall daily hear; <br> Till in life's latest hour I bow, <br> And bless, in death, a bond so dear. [Refrain <br>  <br> Source: African Methodist Episcopal Church Hymnal #<br>241</p>
