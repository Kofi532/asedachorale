        <p><br>1 Here, O my Lord, I see Thee face to face; <br> here would we touch and handle things unseen; <br> here grasp with firmer hand eternal grace <br> and all my weariness upon Thee lean. <br> <br>2 Here would I feed upon the bread of God, <br> here drink with Thee the royal wine of heav'n; <br> here would I lay aside each earthly load, <br> here taste afresh the calm of sin forgiv'n. <br> <br>3 This is the hour of banquet and of song; <br> this is the heav'nly table spread for me; <br> here let me feast, and feasting, still prolong <br> the brief, bright hour of fellowship with Thee. <br> <br>4 Too soon we rise, the symbols disappear; <br> the feast, though not the love, is past and done; <br> gone are the bread and wine, but Thou art here, <br> nearer than ever, still my Shield and Sun. <br> <br>5 Feast after feast thus comes, and passes by; <br> yet passing, points to the glad feast above; <br> giving sweet foretaste of the festal joy, <br> the Lamb's great bridal feast of bliss and love. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God #<br>380</p>
