        <p><br>1 Savior, sprinkle many nations; <br> Fruitful let thy sorrows be; <br> By thy pains and consolations <br> Draw the Gentiles unto thee. <br> Of thy Cross the wondrous story <br> Be it to the nations told; <br> Let them see thee in thy glory <br> And thy mercy manifold. A-men. <br> <br>2 Far and wide, though all unknowing, <br> Pants for thee each mortal breast; <br> Human tears for thee are flowing, <br> Human hearts in thee would rest; <br> Thirsting as for dews of even, <br> As the new-mown grass for rain, <br> Thee they seek, as God of heaven, <br> Thee as Man for sinners slain. <br> <br>3 Saviour, lo! the isles are waiting, <br> Stretched the hand, and strained the sight, <br> For thy Spirit new-creating, <br> Love's pure flame, and wisdom's light; <br> Give the word, and of the preacher <br> Speed the foot and touch the tongue, <br> Till on earth by every creature <br> Glory to the Lamb be sung. <br> Amen. <br>  <br> Source: Service Book and Hymnal of the Lutheran Church in America #<br>312</p>
