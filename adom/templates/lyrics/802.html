        <p><br>1 The heav'ns declare Thy glory, LORD; <br> in every star Thy wisdom shines; <br> but when our eyes behold Thy word, <br> we read Thy name in fairer lines. <br> <br>2 The rolling sun, the changing light, <br> and nights and days Thy pow'r confess; <br> but the blest volume Thou hast writ <br> reveals Thy justice and Thy grace. <br> <br>3 Sun, moon, and stars convey Thy praise <br> round the whole earth, and never stand; <br> so when Thy truth began its race, <br> it touched and glanced on every land. <br> <br>4 Nor shall Thy spreading gospel rest <br> till through the world Thy truth has run; <br> till Christ has all the nations blest <br> that see the light, or feel the sun. <br> <br>5 Great Sun of righteousness, arise, <br> bless the dark world with heav'nly light: <br> Thy gospel makes the simple wise; <br> Thy laws are pure, Thy judgments right. <br> <br>6 Thy noblest wonders here we view <br> in souls renewed and sins forgiv'n; <br> Lord, cleanse my sins, my soul renew, <br> and make Thy word my guide to heav'n. <br>  <br> Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God #<br>19A</p>
