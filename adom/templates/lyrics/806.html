        <p><br>1 Let the song go round the earth, <br> Jesus Christ is Lord! <br> Sound His praises, tell His worth, <br> Be His Name adored; <br> Every clime and every tongue <br> Join the grand, the glorious song! <br> <br>2 Let the song go round the earth! <br> From the eastern sea, <br> Where the daylight has its birth, <br> Glad, and bright, and free! <br> China's millions join the strains, <br> Waft them on to India's plains. <br> <br>3 Let the song go round the earth! <br> Lands where Islam's sway <br> Darkly broods o'er home and hearth, <br> Cast their bonds away! <br> Let His praise from Afric's shore <br> Rise and swell her wide lands o'er! <br> <br>4 Let the song go round the earth! <br> Where the summer smiles; <br> Let the notes of holy mirth <br> Break from distant isles! <br> Inland forests, dark and dim, <br> Icebound coasts give back the hymn. <br> <br>5 Let the son go round the earth! <br> Jesus Christ is King! <br> With the story of His worth <br> Let the whole world ring! <br> Him creation all adore <br> Evermore and evermore! <br> Amen. <br>  <br> Source: Worship and Service Hymnal: For Church, School, and Home #<br>441</p>
