        <p><br>1 Speed thy servants, Saviour, speed them; <br> Thou art Lord of winds and waves; <br> They were bound, but thou hast freed them; <br> Now they go to free the slaves: <br> Be thou with them, <br> 'Tis thine arm alone that save. <br> Be thou with them, <br> 'Tis thine arm alone that saves. <br> <br>2 Friends, and home, and all forsaking, <br> Lord they go at thy command, <br> As their stay thy promise taking, <br> While they traverse sea and land: <br> O be with them; <br> Lead them safely by the hand. <br> O be with them; <br> Lead them safely by the hand. <br> <br>3 When they reach the land of strangers, <br> And the prospect dark appears, <br> Nothing seen but toils and dangers, <br> Nothing felt but doubts and fears, <br> Be thou with them, <br> Hear their sighs and count their tears. <br> Be thou with them, <br> Hear their sighs and count their tears. <br> <br>4 Where no fruit appears to cheer them, <br> And they seem to toil in vain, <br> Then in mercy, Lord, draw near them, <br> Then their sinking hopes sustain: <br> Thus supported, <br> Let their zeal revive again. <br> Thus supported, <br> Let their zeal revive again. <br> <br>5 In the midst of opposition <br> Let them trust, O Lord, in thee; <br> When success attends their mission, <br> Let thy servants humbler be: <br> Never leave them <br> Till thy face in heav'n they see. <br> Never leave them <br> Till thy face in heav'n they see. <br> Amen. <br>  <br> Source: Trinity Hymnal #<br>382</p>
