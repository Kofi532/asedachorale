<p><b>P.H.B {{ clicked_value }} </b></p>
<p> 1. Come all you people come now,
Prepare your hearts for God.
Trespassers, God will forgive,
Wonderful Savior comes.
The glory of the Lord,
The Light that God did promise,
Has come and now dwells with us,
We, welcome Jesus Christ. <br/><br/>2 Righteous paths come and seek now,
Prepare to welcome Him.
Make straight the crooked paths then,
Forsake the life of wrong.
For He who comes from High,
Immanuel God hates sin.
Has come to save us sinners,
Prepare your heart for Him. <br> <br> 3 The broken, contrite heart seek,
The Lord shall enter here.
Prideful, boastful life God hates,
Disgrace shall come to such.
In hearts with no deceit,
The heart that seeks the Lord's truth,
A heart prepared for Jesus,
He'll come and enter there. <br> <br> 4 Prepare me dear Lord Jesus,
By grace, prepare me, Lord.
By this I shall be ready,
Be ready for you Lord.
My heart is â€˜manger' now,
Come and be born in this heart,
Then I shall praise you always,
And worship you my Lord. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string -->
