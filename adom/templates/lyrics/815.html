        <p><br>1 Hills of the North, rejoice, <br> river and mountain-spring, <br> hark to the advent voice; <br> valley and lowland, sing. <br> Christ comes in righteousness and love, <br> he brings salvation from above. <br> <br>2 Isles of the Southern seas, <br> sing to the listening earth, <br> carry on every breeze <br> hope of a world's new birth: <br> In Christ shall all be made anew, <br> his word is sure, his promise true. <br> <br>3 Lands of the East, arise, <br> he is your brightest morn, <br> greet him with joyous eyes, <br> praise shall his path adorn: <br> your seers have longed to know their Lord; <br> to you he comes, the final word. <br> <br>4 Shores of the utmost West, <br> lands of the setting sun, <br> welcome the heavenly guest <br> in whom the dawn has come: <br> he brings a never-ending light <br> who triumphed o'er our darkest night. <br> <br>5 Shout, as you journey home, <br> songs be in every mouth, <br> lo, from the North they come, <br> from East and West and South: <br> in Jesus all shall find their rest, <br> in him the universe be blest. <br>  <br> Source: Ancient and Modern: hymns and songs for refreshing worship #<br>39</p>
