        <p><br>1 The Son of God goes forth to war, <br> a kingly crown to gain; <br> His blood-red banner streams afar! <br> Who follows in his train? <br> Who best can drink His cup of woe, <br> triumphant over pain, <br> who patient bears his cross below, <br> he follows in His train. <br> <br>2 The martyr first, whose eagle eye <br> could pierce beyond the grave; <br> who saw his Master in the sky <br> and called on Him to save. <br> Like Him, with pardon on His tongue <br> in midst of mortal pain, <br> he prayed for them that did the wrong! <br> Who follows in His train? <br> <br>3 A glorious band, the chosen few <br> on whom the Spirit came, <br> twelve valiant saints, their hope they knew, <br> and mocked the cross and flame. <br> They met the tyrant's brandished steel, <br> the lion's gory mane; <br> they bowed their necks the death to feel: <br> who follows in their train? <br> <br>4 A noble army, men and boys, <br> the matron and the maid, <br> around the Savior's throne rejoice <br> in robes of light arrayed. <br> They climbed the steep ascent of heav'n <br> through peril, toil and pain; <br> O God, to us may grace be giv'n <br> to follow in their train. <br>  <br> Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God #<br>429</p>
