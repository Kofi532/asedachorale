        <p><br><br>1 Onward, Christian soldiers, <br> marching as to war, <br> With the cross of Jesus <br> going on before! <br> Christ, the royal Master, <br> leads against the foe; <br> Forward into battle, <br> see his banner go! <br> Refrain: <br> Onward, Christian soldiers, <br> marching as to war, <br> With the cross of Jesus <br> going on before! <br> <br><br>2 At the sign of triumph <br> Satan's host doth flee; <br> On, then, Christian soldiers, <br> on to victory! <br> Hell's foundations quiver <br> at the shout of praise; <br> Brothers, lift your voices, <br> loud your anthems raise! [Refrain] <br> <br><br>3 Like a mighty army <br> moves the church of God; <br> Brothers, we are treading <br> where the saints have trod; <br> We are not divided; <br> all one body we, <br> One in hope and doctrine, <br> one in charity. [Refrain] <br> <br><br>4 Onward, then, ye people, <br> join our happy throng, <br> Blend with ours your voices <br> in the triumph song; <br> Glory, laud, and honor, <br> unto Christ the King; <br> This thro' countless ages <br> men and angels sing. [Refrain] <br> Baptist Hymnal, <br><br>1991</p>
