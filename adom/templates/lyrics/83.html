        <p><br>1 Of the FatherÃÂs love begotten, <br> ere the worlds began to be, <br> He is Alpha and Omega, <br> He the Source, the Ending He, <br> of the things that are, that have been, <br> and that future years shall see <br> evermore and evermore! <br> <br>2 O that birth forever blessed, <br> when a virgin, full of grace, <br> by the Holy Ghost conceiving, <br> bore the Savior of our race; <br> and the Babe, the worldÃÂs Redeemer, <br> first revealed His sacred face, <br> evermore and evermore! <br> <br>3 This is He whom heav'n-taught singers <br> sang of old with one accord, <br> whom the Scriptures of the prophets <br> promised in their faithful word; <br> now He shines, the long-expected; <br> let creation praise its Lord, <br> evermore and evermore! <br> <br>4 O ye heights of heav'n, adore Him; <br> angel hosts, His praises sing: <br> pow'rs, dominions, bow before Him <br> and extol our God and King; <br> let no tongue on earth be silent, <br> every voice in concert ring, <br> evermore and evermore! <br> <br>5 Christ, to Thee with God the Father, <br> and, O Holy Ghost, to Thee, <br> hymn and chant and high thanksgiving <br> and unwearied praises be, <br> honor, glory, and dominion, <br> and eternal victory, <br> evermore and evermore! <br>  <br> Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God #<br>252</p>
