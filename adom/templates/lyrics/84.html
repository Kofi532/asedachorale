<p><b>P.H.B {{ clicked_value }} </b></p>
<p> 1. We expect no other Savior,
There is none but Jesus Christ.
My soul put not trust in others,
There is only One Savior.
Do you know the Lord Jesus?
One that died sinners to save;
Christ the Savior, we all expect,
He delivered us from evil. <br/><br/>2 All the blind now see in Jesus,
Lepers too are clean in Him.
The lame walk promptly at His Word,
Why must I doubt Jesus Christ?
He raised the dead back to life.
They received life from the Lord.
Do you know one who is like Him?
There is no one else like Jesus. <br> <br> 3 In this Advent all must come now,
Come in droves to Jesus Christ.
Come to seek grace from Christ the Lord,
Grace in Him for all sinners.
What men find so hard to grasp,
That God should become like us.
In such meekness He comes to us,
In His sufferings we are all saved. <br> <br> 4 I was once blind like those that hate,
I was full of pride in sin.
Help my unbelief grant me faith,
In your merit I must trust.
All your suffering, pain and shame,
In our pride, we fail to see.
We reject the way of suffering,
We see Christ's â€˜Cross' as foolishness. <br> <br> 5 I have great joy in Christ Jesus,
In Him I am satisfied.
You have saved my soul from death,
[Lord,
You have set me free from sin.
Lord I long to see your face,
Be with you, remain in you.
In your Kingdom in the heavens,
Let me be so close to you, Lord. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string -->
