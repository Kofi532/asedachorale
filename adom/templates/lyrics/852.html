        <p><br>1 All things which live below the sky, <br> Or move within the sea, <br> Are creatures of the Lord most High, <br> And brothers unto me. <br> <br>2 I love to hear the robin sing, <br> Perched on the highest bough; <br> To see the rook with purple wing, <br> Follow the shining plough. <br> <br>3 I love to watch the swallow skim <br> The river in his flight; <br> To mark, when day is growing dim, <br> The glowworm's sil'v'ry light. <br> <br>4 The seagull whiter than the foam, <br> The fish that dart beneath; <br> The lowing cattle coming home; <br> The goats upon the heath. <br> <br>5 God taught the wren to build her nest, <br> The lark to soar above, <br> The hen to gather to her breast <br> The offspring of her love. <br> <br>6 Beneath his heaven there's room for all; <br> He gives to all their meat; <br> He sees the meanest sparrow fall <br> Unnoticed in the street. <br> <br>7 All-loving Father, King of kings, <br> The helper of the weak, <br> Make me a friend of helpless things, <br> Defender of the weak. <br>  <br> Source: The Hymnal for Boys and Girls #<br>102</p>
