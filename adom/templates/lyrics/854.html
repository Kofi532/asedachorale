        <p><br>1 It is a thing most wonderful, <br> almost too wonderful to be, <br> that God's own Son should come from heav'n, <br> and die to save a child like me. <br> <br>2 And yet I know that it is true: <br> He chose a poor and humble lot, <br> and wept and toiled and mourned and died <br> for love of those who loved Him not. <br> <br>3 I cannot tell how He could love <br> a child so weak and full of sin; <br> His love must be most wonderful <br> if He could die my love to win. <br> <br>4 I sometimes think about the cross, <br> and shut my eyes, and try to see <br> the cruel nails and crown of thorns, <br> and Jesus crucified for me. <br> <br>5 But even could I see Him die, <br> I could but see a little part <br> of that great love which, like a fire, <br> is always burning in His heart. <br> <br>6 It is most wonderful to know <br> His love for me so free and sure; <br> but 'tis more wonderful to see <br> my love for Him so faint and poor. <br> <br>7 And yet I want to love Thee, Lord; <br> O light the flame within my heart, <br> and I will love Thee more and more, <br> until I see Thee as Thou art. <br>  <br> Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God #<br>277</p>
