        <p><br>1 I think when I read that sweet story of old, <br> When Jesus was here among men, <br> How He called little children as lambs to His fold, <br> I should like to have been with them then. <br> Refrain: <br> I should like to have been with them then, <br> I should like to have been with them then; <br> How He called little children as lambs to His fold, <br> I should like to have been with them then. <br> <br>2 I wish that His hands had been placed on my head, <br> That His arm had been thrown around me; <br> And that I might have seen His kind look when He said, <br> "Let the little ones come unto Me." <br> Refrain: <br> "Let the little ones come unto Me, <br> Let the little ones come unto Me;" <br> And that I might have seen His kind look when He said, <br> "Let the little ones come unto Me." <br> <br>3 Yet still to His footstool in prayer I may go, <br> And ask for a share in His love; <br> And if I now earnestly seek Him below, <br> I shall see Him and hear Him above. <br> Refrain: <br> I shall see Him and hear Him above, <br> I shall see Him and hear Him above; <br> And if I now earnestly seek Him below, <br> I shall see Him and hear Him above. <br> <br>4 In that beautiful place He has gone to prepare, <br> For all who are washed and forgiven; <br> And many dear children are gathering there, <br> For "Of such is the kingdom of heaven." <br> Refrain: <br> For "Of such is the kingdom of heaven," <br> For "Of such is the kingdom of heaven;" <br> And many dear children are gathering there, <br> For "Of such is the kingdom of heaven." <br>  <br>  <br> Source: African Methodist Episcopal Church Hymnal #<br>542</p>
