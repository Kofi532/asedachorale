        <p><br>1 When mothers of Salem <br> Their children brought to Jesus, <br> The stern disciples drove them back <br> And bade them depart; <br> But Jesus saw them ere they fled, <br> And sweetly smiled, and kindly said, <br> "Suffer little children <br> To come unto Me. <br> <br>2 "For I will receive them <br> And fold them in my bosom; <br> I'll be a shepherd to these lambs, <br> O drive them not away; <br> For, if their hearts to Me they give, <br> They shall with Me in glory live: <br> Suffer little children <br> To come unto Me." <br> <br>3 How kind was our Savior <br> To bid these children welcome! <br> But there are many thousands <br> Who have never heard His name; <br> The Bible they have never read; <br> They know not that the Savior said, <br> "Suffer little children <br> To come unto Me." <br> <br>4 O soon may the heathen <br> Of every tribe and nation <br> Fulfill Thy blessed word, <br> And cast their idols all away; <br> O shine upon them from above, <br> And show Thyself a God of love; <br> Teach the little children <br> To come unto Thee. <br> Amen. <br>  <br> Source: African Methodist Episcopal Church Hymnal #<br>543</p>
