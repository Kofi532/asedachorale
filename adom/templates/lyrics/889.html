        <p><br>1 God of our fathers, known of old, <br> Lord of our far-flung battle line, <br> Beneath whose awful hand we hold <br> Dominion over palm and pine: <br> Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, <br> Lest we forget, lest we forget! <br> <br>2 The tumult and the shouting dies; <br> The captains and the kings depart; <br> Still stands Thine ancient sacrifice, <br> An humble and a contrite heart: <br> Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, <br> Lest we forget, lest we forget! <br> <br>3 Far called our navies melt away. <br> On dune and headland sinks the fire; <br> Lo, all our pomp of yesterday <br> Is one with Nineveh and Tyre! <br> Judge of the nations, spare us yet, <br> Lest we forget, lest we forget! <br> <br>4 If, drunk with sight of power, we loose <br> Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe, <br> Such boasting as the Gentiles use <br> Or lesser breeds without the law: <br> Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, <br> Lest we forget, lest we forget! <br> <br>5 For heathen heart that puts her trust <br> In reeking tube and iron shard; <br> All valiant dust that builds on dust, <br> And guarding calls not Thee to guard: <br> For frantic boast and foolish word, <br> Thy mercy on Thy people, Lord! <br>  <br> Source: The A.M.E.
