        <p><br>1 Where cross the crowded ways of life, <br> where sound the cries of race and clan, <br> above the noise of selfish strife, <br> we hear your voice, O Son of Man. <br> <br>2 In haunts of wretchedness and need, <br> on shadowed thresholds fraught with fears, <br> from paths where hide the lures of greed, <br> we catch the vision of your tears. <br> <br>3 From tender childhood's helplessness, <br> from human grief and burdened toil, <br> from famished souls, from sorrow's stress, <br> your heart has never known recoil. <br> <br>4 The cup of water given for you <br> still holds the freshness of your grace; <br> yet long these multitudes to view <br> the sweet compassion of your face. <br> <br>5 O Master, from the mountainside, <br> make haste to heal these hearts of pain; <br> among these restless throngs abide; <br> O tread the city's streets again; <br> <br>6 Till all the world shall learn your love, <br> and follow where your feet have trod; <br> till glorious from your heaven above <br> shall come the city of our God. <br>  <br> Source: Glory to God: the Presbyterian Hymnal #<br>343</p>
