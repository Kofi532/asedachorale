        <p><br><br>1 Christ, of all my hopes the ground, <br> Christ, the spring of all my joy, <br> still in you may I be found, <br> still for you my pow'rs employ, <br> still for you my pow'rs employ. <br> <br><br>2 Let your love my heart inflame; <br> keep your fear before my sight; <br> be your praise my highest aim; <br> be your smile my chief delight, <br> be your smile my chief delight. <br> <br><br>3 Fountain of o'erflowing grace, <br> freely from your fullness give; <br> 'til I close my earthly race, <br> may I prove it "Christ to live," <br> may I prove it "Christ to live." <br> <br><br>4 Firmly trusting in your blood, <br> nothing shall my heart confound; <br> safely I shall pass the flood, <br> safely reach Immanuel's ground, <br> safely reach Immanuel's ground. <br> <br><br>5 Thus, O thus, an entrance give <br> to the land of cloudless sky; <br> having known it "Christ to live," <br> let me know it "gain to die," <br> let me know it "gain to die." <br>  <br> Source: Trinity Psalter Hymnal #<br><br>447</p>
