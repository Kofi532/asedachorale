        <p><br>1 Behold! the mountain of the Lord <br> in latter days shall rise <br> on mountain tops above the hills, <br> and draw the wondering eyes. <br> <br>2 To this the joyful nations round, <br> all tribes and tongues, shall flow; <br> up to the hill of God, they'll say, <br> and to his house we'll go. <br> <br>3 The beam that shines from Zion hill <br> shall lighten every land; <br> the King who reigns in Salem's towers <br> shall all the world command. <br> <br>4 Among the nations he shall judge; <br> his judgements truth shall guide; <br> his sceptre shall protect the just, <br> and quell the sinnerÂ’s pride. <br> <br>5 No strife shall rage, nor hostile feuds <br> disturb those peaceful years; <br> to ploughshares men shall beat their swords, <br> to pruning-hooks their spears. <br> <br>6 No longer hosts, encountering hosts, <br> shall crowds of slain deplore: <br> they hang the trumpet in the hall, <br> and study war no more. <br> <br>7 Come then, O house of Jacob! come <br> to worship at his shrine; <br> and, walking in the light of God, <br> with holy beauties shine. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Hymns of Glory, Songs of Praise #<br>715</p>
