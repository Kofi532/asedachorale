        <p>Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky, <br> The flying cloud, the frosty light: <br> The year is dying in the night; <br> Ring out, wild bells, and let him die. <br> Ring out the old, ring in the new, <br> Ring, happy bells, across the snow: <br> The year is going, let him go; <br> Ring out the false, ring in the true. <br> Ring out the grief that saps the mind, <br> For those that here we see no more; <br> Ring out the feud of rich and poor, <br> Ring in redress to all mankind. <br> Ring out false pride in place and blood, <br> The civic slander and the spite; <br> Ring in the love of truth and right, <br> Ring in the common love of good. <br> Ring out old shapes of foul disease, <br> Ring out the narrowing lust of gold; <br> Ring out the thousand wars of old, <br> Ring in the thousand years of peace. <br> Ring in the valiant man and free, <br> The larger heart, the kindlier hand; <br> Ring out the darkness of the land, <br> Ring in the Christ that is to be.</p>
