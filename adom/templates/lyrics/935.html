        <p><br>1. Father divine, I come to Thee, <br> I yield, a captive, to Thy sway, <br> That loves gold chain may set me free <br> For all the burden of the day. <br> <br>2. I come not to avoid my care, <br> I come not to desert the strife; <br> I come to seek new strength to bear, <br> I fly to find new power for life. <br> <br>3. Many there be that seek Thy face <br> To meet the hour of parting breath, <br> But tis for earth I need Thy grace <br> Life is more solemn still than death. <br> <br>4. When morning gilds the porch of day, <br> I feel so vile amid the glow <br> That I should faint, didst Thou not say, <br> I make thee whiter than the snow! <br> <br>5. When noontide brings its work to all, <br> I find my task so hard to be, <br> That I should sink, didst Thou not call, <br> My strength is perfected in thee! <br> <br>6. When darkness leads the world to rest, <br> The silent burden of the night <br> Would crush, but for Thy message blest, <br> At evening time there shall be light! <br> <br>7. Oh, may these streams of golden light <br> To all my desert way be given, <br> Till faith itself is lost in sight, <br> And days on earth be days of Heaven.</p>
