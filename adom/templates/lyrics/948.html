        <p><br>1 Abide with me: fast falls the eventide; <br> the darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide. <br> When other helpers fail and comforts flee, <br> Help of the helpless, O abide with me. <br> <br>2 Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day; <br> earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away. <br> Change and decay in all around I see. <br> O thou who changest not, abide with me. <br> <br>3 I need thy presence every passing hour. <br> What but thy grace can foil the tempter's power? <br> Who like thyself my guide and strength can be? <br> Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me. <br> <br>4 I fear no foe with thee at hand to bless, <br> ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness. <br> Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory? <br> I triumph still, if thou abide with me. <br> <br>5 Hold thou thy cross before my closing eyes. <br> Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies. <br> Heaven's morning breaks and earth's vain shadows flee; <br> in life, in death, O Lord, abide with me. <br> Lift Up Your Hearts, <br>2013</p>
