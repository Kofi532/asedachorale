        <p><br><br>1 The day is past and over; <br> all thanks, O Lord, to thee; <br> I pray thee that sinless <br> the hours of dark may be: <br> O Jesu, keep me in thy sight, <br> and guard me through the coming night. <br> <br><br>2 The joys of day are over; <br> I lift my heart to thee, <br> and ask thee that offenceless <br> the hours of dark may be: <br> O Jesu, keep me in thy sight, <br> and guard me through the coming night. <br> <br><br>3 The toils of day are over; <br> I lift my heart to thee, <br> and ask that free from peril <br> the hours of dark may be: <br> O Jesu, keep me in thy sight, <br> and guard me through the coming night. <br> <br><br>4 Be thou my soul's preserver, <br> for thou alone dost know <br> how many are the perils <br> through which I have to go: <br> O loving Jesu, hear my call, <br> and guard and save me from them all. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br><br>25</p>
