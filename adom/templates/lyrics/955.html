        <p><br>1 STANDING at the portal <br> Of the opning year, <br> Words of comfort meet us, <br> Hushing evry fear, <br> Spoken through the silence <br> By our Fathers voice, <br> Tender, strong, and faithful, <br> Making us rejoice. <br> Onward, then, and fear not, <br> Children of the day! <br> For His Word shall never, <br> Never pass away!<br>2 J, the Lord, am with thee, <br> Be thou not afraid! <br> I will help and strengthen, <br> Be thou not dismayed! <br> Yea, I will uphold thee <br> With My own right hand; <br> Thou art called and chosen <br> In My sight to stand.<br>3 For the year before us, <br> O what rich supplies! <br> For the poor and needy <br> Living streams shall rise; <br> For the sad and sinful <br> Shall His grace abound, <br> For the faint and feeble <br> Perfect strength be found.<br>4 He will never fail us, <br> He will not forsake; <br> His eternal covenant <br> He will never break! <br> Resting on His promise, <br> What have we to fear? <br> God is all-sufficient <br> For the coming year. <br>  <br> Source: Redemption Hymnal #<br>125a</p>
