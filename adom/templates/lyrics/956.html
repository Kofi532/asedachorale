<p><br/>1. Come, let us anew our journey pursue, <br/> Roll round with the year, <br/> And never stand still till the Master appear. <br/> His adorable will let us gladly fulfill, <br/> And our talents improve <br/> By the patience of hope and the labor of love, <br/> By the patience of hope and the labor of love.<br/>2. Our life as a dream, our time as a stream <br/> Glide swiftly away, <br/> And the fugitive moment refuses to stay; <br/> For the arrow is flown and the moments are gone. <br/> The millennial year <br/> Presses on to our view, and eternityÂs here, <br/> Presses on to our view, and eternityÂs here.<br/>3. Oh, that each in the day of His coming may say, <br/> ÂI have fought my way thru; <br/> I have finished the work thou didst give me to do.Â <br/> Oh, that each from his Lord may receive the glad word: <br/> ÂWell and faithfully done; <br/> Enter into my joy and sit down on my throne; <br/> Enter into my joy and sit down on my throne.Â <br/> <br/> Source: Hymns of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints #<br/>217</p>
