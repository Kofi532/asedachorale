        <p><br>1 Sing to the great Jehovah's praise! <br> All praise to Him belongs; <br> Who kindly lengthens out our days, <br> Inspires our choicest songs, <br> Inspires our choicest songs. <br> <br>2 His providence hath brought us through <br> Another various year; <br> We all, with vows and anthems new, <br> Before our God appear, <br> Before our God appear. <br> <br>3 O God, Thy mercies past we own, <br> And Thy continued care; <br> To Thee presenting through Thy Son <br> Whate'er we have and are, <br> Whate'er we have and are. <br>  <br> Source: Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal #<br>105</p>
