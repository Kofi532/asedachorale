<p><br/>1 Come, ye thankful people, come, <br/> raise the song of harvest home; <br/> all is safely gathered in, <br/> ere the winter storms begin. <br/> God our Maker doth provide <br/> for our wants to be supplied; <br/> come to God's own temple, come, <br/> raise the song of harvest home. <br/> <br/>2 All the world is God's own field, <br/> fruit as praise to God we yield; <br/> wheat and tares together sown <br/> are to joy or sorrow grown; <br/> first the blade and then the ear, <br/> then the full corn shall appear; <br/> Lord of harvest, grant that we <br/> wholesome grain and pure may be. <br/> <br/>3 For the Lord our God shall come, <br/> and shall take the harvest home; <br/> from the field shall in that day <br/> all offenses purge away, <br/> giving angels charge at last <br/> in the fire the tares to cast; <br/> but the fruitful ears to store <br/> in the garner evermore. <br/> <br/>4 Even so, Lord, quickly come, <br/> bring thy final harvest home; <br/> gather thou thy people in, <br/> free from sorrow, free from sin, <br/> there, forever purified, <br/> in thy presence to abide; <br/> come, with all thine angels, come, <br/> raise the glorious harvest home. <br/> United Methodist Hymnal, <br/>1989</p>
