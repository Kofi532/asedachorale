        <p><br>1 Earth below is teeming, <br> Heavn is bright above; <br> Evry brow is beaming <br> In the light of love; <br> Evry eye rejoices, <br> Evry thought is praise: <br> Happy hearts and voices <br> Gladden nights and days. <br> Refrain: <br> O Almighty Giver! <br> Bountiful and free, <br> As the joy in harvest <br> Joy we before thee. <br> <br>2 For the sun and showers, <br> For the rain and dew, <br> For the happy hours <br> Spring and Summer knew; <br> For the golden Autumn <br> And its precious stores, <br> For the love that brought them <br> Teeming to our doors. [Refrain] <br> <br>3 Earths broad harvest whitens <br> In a brighter sun <br> Than the orb that lightens <br> All we tread upon; <br> Send our labrers, Father! <br> Where fields ripning wave, <br> And the nations gather, <br> Gather in and save. [Refrain] <br>  <br> Source: Gloria Deo: a Collection of Hymns and Tunes for Public Worship in all Departments of the Church #<br>581</p>
