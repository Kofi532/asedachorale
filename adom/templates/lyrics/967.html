<p><br/>1 Now the year is crowned with blessing <br/> As we gather in the grain; <br/> And, our grateful thanks expressing, <br/> Loud we raise a joyous strain. <br/> Bygone days of toil and sadness <br/> Cannot now our peace destroy; <br/> For the hills are clothed with gladness, <br/> And the valleys shout for joy. <br/> Refrain: <br/> To the Lord their first-fruits bringing, <br/> All His thankful people come, <br/> To the Father praises singing <br/> For the joy of harvest-home. <br/> <br/>2 In the spring the smiling meadows <br/> Donned their robes of living green, <br/> As the sunshine chased the shadows <br/> Swiftly o'er the changing scene; <br/> In the summer-time the story <br/> Of a riper hope was told; <br/> Then the rich autumnal glory <br/> Decked the fields in cloth of gold. [Refrain] <br/> <br/>3 Shall not we, whose hearts are swelling <br/> With the thought of former days, <br/> Sing a joyous song foretelling <br/> Future gladness, fuller praise? <br/> For the cloud the bow retaineth <br/> With its covenant of peace, <br/> That, as long as earth remaineth, <br/> Harvest-time shall never cease. [Refrain] <br/> <br/>4 Though the fig-tree may not flourish, <br/> Though the vine no fruit may yield, <br/> Though the earth no flocks may nourish <br/> In the fold or in the field, <br/> Still our hearts will trust His power <br/> Who the ravens stoops to feed, <br/> And the hand that clothes each flower <br/> Shall supply our utmost need. [Refrain] <br/> <br/> Source: Methodist Hymn and Tune Book: official hymn book of the Methodist Church #<br/>626</p>
