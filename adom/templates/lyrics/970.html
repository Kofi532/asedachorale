        <p><br>1 Hear us, O Lord, from heaven Thy dwelling-place: <br> Like them of old, in vain we toil all night, <br> Unless with us Thou go, who art the Light; <br> Come then, O Lord, that we may see Thy face. <br> <br>2 Thou, Lord, dost rule the raging of the sea, <br> When loud the storm and furious is the gale: <br> Strong is Thine arm; our little barques are frail: <br> Send us Thy help; remember Galilee. <br> <br>3 Our wives and children we commend to Thee: <br> For them we plough the land and plough the deep; <br> For them by day the golden corn we reap, <br> By night the silver harvest of the sea. <br> <br>4 We thank Thee, Lord, for sunshine, dew, and rain, <br> Broadcast from heaven by Thine almighty hand <br> Source of all life, unnumbered as the sand <br> Bird, beast, and fish, herb, fruit, and golden grain. <br> <br>5 O Bread of Life, Thou in Thy Word hast said, <br> Who feeds in faith on Me shall never die! <br> In mercy hear Thy hungry children's cry, <br> Father, give us this day our daily bread! <br> <br>6 Sow in our hearts the seeds of Thy dear love, <br> That we may reap contentment, joy, and peace; <br> And when at last our earthly labours cease, <br> Grant us to join Thy harvest home above. <br>  <br> Source: Methodist Hymn and Tune Book: official hymn book of the Methodist Church #<br>466</p>
