        <p><br>1 A gladsome hymn of praise we sing, <br> and thankfully we gather <br> to bless the love of God above, <br> our everlasting Father. <br> <br>2 In Him rejoice with heart and voice, <br> His glory fading never, <br> whose providence is our defence, <br> who lives and loves for ever. [Refrain] <br> <br>3 Full in His sight His children stand, <br> by His strong arm defended, <br> and He whose wisdom guides the world <br> our footsteps has attended. [Refrain] <br> <br>4 For nothing falls unknown to HimÂ– <br> or care or joy or sorrow; <br> and He, whose mercy ruled the past, <br> Will be our stay tomorrow. [Refrain] <br>  <br> Source: The Irish Presbyterian Hymbook #<br>77</p>
