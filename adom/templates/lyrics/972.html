<p><br/>1 Here, Lord, we offer Thee all that is fairest, <br/> Bloom from the garden, and flowers from the field, <br/> Gifts for the stricken ones, knowing Thou carest <br/> More for the love than the wealth that we yield. <br/> <br/>2 Speak, Lord, by these to the sick and the dying; <br/> Speak to their hearts with a message of peace; <br/> Comfort the sad, who in weakness are lying; <br/> Grant the departing a gentle release. <br/> <br/>3 Raise, Lord, to health again those who have sickened, <br/> Fair be their lives as the roses in bloom; <br/> Give of Thy grace to the souls Thou hast quickened, <br/> Gladness for sorrow and brightness for gloom. <br/> <br/>4 We, Lord, like flowers, must bloom and must wither; <br/> We, like these blossoms, must fade and must die; <br/> Gather us, Lord, to Thy bosom for ever, <br/> Grant us a place in Thy home in the sky. <br/> <br/> Source: Methodist Hymn and Tune Book: official hymn book of the Methodist Church #<br/>627</p>
