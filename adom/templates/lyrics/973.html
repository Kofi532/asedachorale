<p><br/>1 Rejoice for a brother deceased; <br/> Our loss is his infinite gain; <br/> A soul out of prison released, <br/> And freed from its bodily pain! <br/> With songs let us follow his flight, <br/> And mount with his spirit above; <br/> Escaped to the mansions of light, <br/> And lodged in the Eden of love. <br/> <br/>2 Our brother the haven hath gained; <br/> Outflying the tempest and wind, <br/> His rest he hath sooner obtained, <br/> And left his companions behind; <br/> Still toss'd on a sea of distress; <br/> Hard-toiling to make the blest shore, <br/> Where all is assurance and peace, <br/> And sorrow and sin are no more. <br/> <br/>3 There all the ship's company meet, <br/> Who sailed with the Saviour beneath; <br/> With shouting each other they greet, <br/> And triumph o'er sorrow and death: <br/> The voyage of life's at an end, <br/> The mortal affliction is past: <br/> The age that in heaven they spend, <br/> For ever and ever shall last. <br/> <br/> Source: The Voice of Praise: a collection of hymns for the use of the Methodist Church #<br/>887</p>
