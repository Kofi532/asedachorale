        <p><br>1 Our Father, by whose servants <br> our house was built of old, <br> whose hand hath crowned her children <br> with blessing manifold, <br> for thine unfailing mercies <br> far strewn along our way, <br> with all who passed before us, <br> we praise thy name today. <br> <br>2 The changeful years unresting <br> their silent course have sped, <br> new comrades ever bringing <br> in comradesÂ’ steps to tread; <br> and some are long forgotten, <br> long spent their hopes and fears; <br> safe rest they in thy keeping, <br> who changest not with years. <br> <br>3 They reap not where they laboured; <br> we reap what they have sown; <br> our harvest may be garnered <br> by ages yet unknown. <br> The days of old have dowered us <br> with gifts beyond all praise; <br> our Father, make us faithful <br> to serve the coming days. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>739</p>
