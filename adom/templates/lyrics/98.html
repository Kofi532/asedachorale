<p><br/>1 Thou hidden source of calm repose, <br/> Thou all-sufficient love divine, <br/> my help and refuge from my foes, <br/> secure I am, if Thou art mine; <br/> from sin and grief and shame I hide me, <br/> Jesus, in Thy name. <br/> <br/>2 Thy mighty name salvation is, <br/> and keeps my happy soul above; <br/> comfort it brings, and pow'r and peace, <br/> and joy and everlasting love; <br/> to me, with Thy dear name, are giv'n <br/> pardon and holiness and heav'n. <br/> <br/>3 Jesus, my all in all Thou art; <br/> my rest in toil, my ease in pain, <br/> the healing of my broken heart, <br/> in war my peace, in loss my gain, <br/> my smile beneath the tyrant's frown, <br/> in shame my glory and my crown. <br/> <br/>4 In want my plentiful supply, <br/> in weakness my almighty pow'r, <br/> in bonds my perfect liberty, <br/> my light in Satan's darkest hour, <br/> my help and stay whene'er call, <br/> my life in death, my heav'n, my all. <br/> <br/> Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God #<br/>426</p>
