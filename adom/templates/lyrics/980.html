        <p><br>1 O Light, from age to age the same, <br> O ever-living Word, <br> Here have we felt thy kindling flame, <br> Thy voice within have heard. <br> <br>2 Here holy thought and hymn and prayer <br> Have winged the spirits powers, <br> And made these walls divinely fair, <br> Thy temple, Lord, and ours. <br> <br>3 What visions rise above the years, <br> What tender memories throng, <br> Till each eye fills with happy tears, <br> Each heart with happy song! <br> <br>4 Vanish the mists of time and sense; <br> They come, the loved of yore, <br> And one encircling providence <br> Holds all for evermore. <br> <br>5 O not in vain their toil, who wrought <br> To build faiths freer shrine; <br> Nor theirs, whose steadfast love and thought <br> Have watched the fire divine. <br> <br>6 Burn, holy Fire, and shine more wide! <br> While systems rise and fall, <br> Faith, hope, and charity abide, <br> The heart and soul of all. <br>  <br> Source: Service Book and Hymnal of the Lutheran Church in America #<br>247</p>
