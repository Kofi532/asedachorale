        <p><br>1. Be with us, gracious Lord, today; <br> This house we dedicate to Thee; <br> O hear Thy servants as they pray, <br> And let Thine ear attentive be! <br> <br>2. Within these walls let holy peace, <br> Let love and truth be always found; <br> May burdened hearts and sweet release, <br> And souls with richest grace be crowned. <br> <br>3. May here be heard the suppliants sigh, <br> The weary enter into rest; <br> Here may the contrite to Thee cry, <br> And waiting souls be richly blessed. <br> <br>4. Here when the Gospel sound is heard, <br> And here proclaimed the saving name, <br> May hearts be quickened, moved and stirred, <br> And souls be kindled into flame. <br> <br>5. Here may the dead be made to live, <br> The dumb to sing, the deaf to hear; <br> And do Thou to the humble give <br> Pardon and peace instead of fear. <br> <br>6. Make this, O Lord, Thine own abode; <br> Thy presence in these courts be givn; <br> Be this, indeed, the house of God, <br> And this in truth the gate of Heavn. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>696</p>
