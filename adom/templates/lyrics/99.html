<p><br/>1 How sweet the name of Jesus sounds <br/> in a believer's ear! <br/> It soothes our sorrows, heals our wounds, <br/> and drives away our fear. <br/> <br/>2 It makes the wounded spirit whole <br/> and calms the troubled breast; <br/> 'tis manna to the hungry soul, <br/> and to the weary, rest. <br/> <br/>3 O Jesus, shepherd, guardian, friend, <br/> my Prophet, Priest, and King, <br/> my Lord, my Life, my Way, my End, <br/> accept the praise I bring. <br/> <br/>4 How weak the effort of my heart, <br/> how cold my warmest thought; <br/> but when I see you as you are, <br/> I'll praise you as I ought. <br/> <br/>5 Till then I would your love proclaim <br/> with every fleeting breath; <br/> and may the music of your name <br/> refresh my soul in death. <br/> Psalter Hymnal, <br/>1987</p>
