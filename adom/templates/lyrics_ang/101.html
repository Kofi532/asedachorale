        <p><br>1. Oerwhelmed in depths of woe, <br> Upon the tree of scorn, <br> Hangs the Redeemer of mankind, <br> With racking anguish torn. <br> <br>2. See how the nails those hands <br> And feet so tender rend; <br> See down His face, and neck, and breast <br> His sacred blood descend. <br> <br>3. Oh, hear that last, loud cry <br> Which pierced His mothers heart, <br> As into God the Fathers hands <br> He bade His soul depart. <br> <br>4. Earth hears, and trembling quakes <br> Around that tree of pain; <br> The rocks are rent; the graves are burst; <br> The veil is rent in twain. <br> <br>5. Shall man alone be mute? <br> Have we no griefs, or fears? <br> Come, old and young, come, all mankind, <br> And bathe those feet in tears. <br> <br>6. Come, fall before His cross, <br> Who shed for us His blood, <br> Who died, the victim of pure love, <br> To make us sons of God. <br> <br>7. Jesu, all praise to Thee, <br> Our joy and endless rest; <br> Be Thou our guide while pilgrims here, <br> Our crown amid the blest. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>5002</p>
