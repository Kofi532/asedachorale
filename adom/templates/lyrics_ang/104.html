HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1. O sinner, lift the eye of faith, <br> To true repentance turning; <br> Bethink thee of the curse of sin, <br> Its awful guilt discerning; <br> Upon the Crucified One look, <br> And thou shalt read, as in a book, <br> What well is worthy thy learning. <br> <br>2. Look on His head, that bleeding head, <br> With crown of thorns surrounded; <br> Look on His sacred hands and feet <br> Which piercing nails have wounded; <br> See every limb with scourges rent: <br> On Him, the Just, the Innocent, <br> What malice hath abounded! <br> <br>3. Tis not alone those limbs are racked, <br> But friends, too, are forsaking; <br> And, more than all, for thankless man <br> That tender heart is aching; <br> Oh, fearful was the pain and scorn, <br> By Jesus, Son of Mary, borne, <br> Their peace for sinners making. <br> <br>4. None ever knew such pain before, <br> Such infinite affliction, <br> None ever felt a grief like His <br> In that dread crucifixion; <br> For us He bare those bitter throes, <br> For us those agonizing woes, <br> In oft renewed infliction. <br> <br>5. O sinner, mark, and ponder well <br> Sins awful condemnation; <br> Think what a sacrifice it cost <br> To purchase Thy salvation; <br> Had Jesus never bled and died, <br> Then what could thee and all betide <br> But uttermost damnation? <br> <br>6. Lord, give us grace to flee from sin, <br> And Satans wiles ensnaring, <br> And from those everlasting flames <br> For evil ones preparing. <br> Jesu, we thank Thee, and entreat <br> To rest forever at Thy feet, <br> Thy heavenly glory sharing. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>5328</p>
