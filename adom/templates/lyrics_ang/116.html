        <p><br>1 'Lord, when thy kingdom comes, remember me!' <br> Thus spake the dying lips to dying ears; <br> O faith, which in that darkest hour could see <br> the promised glory of the far-off years! <br> <br>2 No kingly sign declares that glory now, <br> no ray of hope lights up that awful hour; <br> a thorny crown surrounds the bleeding brow, <br> the hands are stretched in weakness, not in power. <br> <br>3 Hark! Through the gloom the dying Saviour saith, <br> 'thou too shalt rest in paradise today:' <br> O words of love to answer words of faith! <br> O words of hope for those who live to pray! <br> <br>4 Lord, when with dying lips my prayer is said, <br> grant that in faith thy Kingdom I may see; <br> and, thinking on thy cross and bleeding head, <br> may breathe my parting words, 'remember me.' <br> *<br>5 Remember me, but not my shame or sin; <br> thy cleansing blood hath washed them all away; <br> thy precious death for me did pardon win; <br> thy blood redeemed me in that awful day. <br> <br>6 Remember me; and, ere I pass away, <br> speak thou the assuring word that sets us free, <br> and make thy promise to my heart, 'Today <br> thou too shalt rest in paradise with me.' <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>159</p>
