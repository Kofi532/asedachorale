        <p><br>1 It is finished! Blessèd Jesus, <br> Thou hast breathed thy latest sigh, <br> Teaching us the sons of Adam <br> How the Son of God can die. <br> <br>2 Lifeless lies the piercèd Body, <br> Resting in its rocky bed; <br> Thou hast left the Cross of anguish <br> For the mansions of the dead. <br> <br>3 In the hidden realms of darkness <br> Shines a light unseen before, <br> When the Lord of dead and living <br> Enters at the lowly door. <br> <br>4 Lo, in spirit, rich in mercy <br> Comes he from the world above, <br> Preaching to the souls in prison <br> Tidings of his dying love. <br> <br>5 Lo, the heavenly light around him, <br> As he draws his people near; <br> All amazed they come rejoicing <br> At the gracious words they hear. <br> <br>6 Patriarch and priest and prophet <br> Gather round him as he stands, <br> In adoring faith and gladness <br> Hearing of the piercèd hands. <br> <br>7 There in lowliest joy and wonder <br> Stands the robber by his side, <br> Reaping now the blessèd promise <br> Spoken by the Crucified. <br> <br>8 Jesus, Lord of our salvation, <br> Let thy mercy rest on me; <br> Grant me too, when life is finished, <br> Rest in Paradise with thee. <br>  <br> Source: The New English Hymnal #<br>99</p>
