        <p><br>1 Light's glittering morn bedecks the sky; <br> heaven thunders forth its victor-cry: <br> Alleluia, alleluia. <br> The glad earth shouts her triumph high, <br> and groaning hell makes wild reply: <br> Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, <br> alleluia, alleluia. <br> <br>2 That Eastertide with joy was bright, <br> the sun shone out with fairer light, <br> when, to their longing eyes restored, <br> the glad apostles saw their Lord: <br> <br>3 He bade them see his hands, his side, <br> where yet the glorious wounds abide; <br> the tokens true which made it plain <br> their Lord indeed was risen again: <br> <br>4 Jesu, the King of gentleness, <br> do thou thyself our hearts possess, <br> that we may give thee all our days <br> the tribute of our grateful praise: <br> <br>5 All praise be thine, O risen Lord, <br> from death to endless life restored; <br> all praise to God the Father be <br> and Holy Ghost eternally: <br>  <br> Source: Ancient and Modern: hymns and songs for refreshing worship #<br>208</p>
