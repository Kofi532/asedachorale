        <p><br>1 Alleluia, alleluia! <br> Hearts to heav'n and voices raise: <br> sing to God a hymn of gladness, <br> sing to God a hymn of praise. <br> He, who on the cross a victim <br> for the world's salvation bled, <br> Jesus Christ, the King of glory, <br> now is risen from the dead. <br> <br>2 Now the iron bars are broken, <br> Christ from death to life is born, <br> glorious life, and life immortal, <br> on the holy Easter morn. <br> Christ has triumphed, and we conquer <br> by His mighty enterprise; <br> we with Him to life eternal <br> by His resurrection rise. <br> <br>3 Christ is risen, Christ, the first-fruits <br> of the holy harvest field, <br> which will all its full abundance <br> at His second coming yield. <br> Then the golden ears of harvest <br> will their heads before Him wave, <br> ripened by His glorious sunshine <br> from the furrows of the grave. <br> <br>4 Christ is risen, we are risen! <br> Shed upon us heav'nly grace, <br> rain and dew and gleams of glory <br> from the brightness of Thy face, <br> that we, with our hearts in heaven, <br> here on earth may fruitful be, <br> and by angel hands be gathered, <br> and be ever, Lord, with Thee. <br> <br>5 Alleluia, alleluia! <br> Glory be to God on high! <br> Alleluia! to the Savior <br> who has gained the victory! <br> Alleluia! to the Spirit, <br> fount of love and sanctity! <br> Alleluia, alleluia <br> to the Triune Majesty! <br>  <br> Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God #<br>284</p>
