        <p><br>1. Jesu, the worlds redeeming Lord, <br> The Fathers co-eternal Word, <br> Of light invisible true light, <br> Thine Israels keeper day and night. <br> <br>2. Our great creator and our guide, <br> Who times and seasons dost divide, <br> Refresh at night with quiet rest, <br> Our limbs by daily toil oppressed. <br> <br>3. That while in this frail house of clay <br> A little longer here we stay, <br> Our flesh in Thee may sweetly sleep, <br> Our souls with Thee their vigils keep. <br> <br>4. We pray Thee, while we dwell below, <br> Preserve us from our ghostly foe; <br> Nor let his wiles victorious be <br> Oer them that are redeemed by Thee. <br> <br>5. O Lord of all, with us abide <br> In this our joyful Eastertide; <br> From every weapon death can wield <br> Thine own redeemed forever shield. <br> <br>6. All praise be Thine, O risen Lord, <br> From death to endless life restored; <br> All praise to God the Father be, <br> And Holy Ghost eternally. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>3498</p>
