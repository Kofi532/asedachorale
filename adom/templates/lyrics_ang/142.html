        <p><br>1 To thee, our God, we fly <br> for mercy and for grace; <br> O hear our lowly cry, <br> and hide not thou thy face. <br> Refrain: <br> O Lord, stretch forth thy mighty hand, <br> and guard and bless our fatherland. <br> <br>2 Arise, O Lord of Hosts, <br> be jealous for thy name, <br> and drive from out our coasts <br> the sins that put to shame. [Refrain] <br> <br>3 Thy best gifts from on high <br> in rich abundance pour, <br> that we may magnify <br> and praise thee more and more. [Refrain] <br> <br>4 The powers ordained by thee <br> with heavenly wisdom bless; <br> may they thy servants be, <br> and rule in righteousness. [Refrain] <br> <br>5 The Church of thy dear Son <br> inflame with love's pure fire, <br> bind her once more in one, <br> with life and truth inspire. [Refrain] <br> *<br>6 The pastors of thy fold <br> with grace and power endue, <br> that faithful, pure, and bold, <br> they may be pastors true. [Refrain] <br> <br>7 O let us love thy house, <br> and sanctify thy day, <br> bring unto thee our vows, <br> and loyal homage pay. [Refrain] <br> <br>8 Give peace, Lord, in our time; <br> O let no foe draw nigh, <br> nor lawless deed of crime <br> insult thy majesty. [Refrain] <br> *<br>9 Though vile and worthless, still <br> thy people, Lord, are we; <br> and for our God we will <br> none other have but thee. [Refrain] <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>189</p>
