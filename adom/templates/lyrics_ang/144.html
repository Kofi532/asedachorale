        <p><br>1. O Lord most high, eternal King, <br> By Thee redeemed Thy praise we sing; <br> The bonds of death are burst by Thee, <br> And grace has won the victory. <br> <br>2. Ascending to the Fathers throne <br> Thou claimst the kingdom as Thine own; <br> Thy days of mortal weakness oer <br> All power is Thine forevermore. <br> <br>3. To Thee the whole creation now <br> Shall, in its threefold order, bow, <br> Of things on earth, and things on high, <br> And things that underneath us lie. <br> <br>4. In awe and wonder angels see <br> How changed is mans estate by Thee, <br> How flesh makes pure as flesh did stain, <br> And Thou, true God, in flesh dost reign. <br> <br>5. Be Thou our Joy, O mighty Lord, <br> As Thou wilt be our great Reward; <br> Let all our glory be in Thee <br> Both now and through eternity. <br> <br>6. All praise from every heart and tongue <br> To Thee, ascended Lord, be sung; <br> All praise to God the Father be <br> And Holy Ghost eternally. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>5117</p>
