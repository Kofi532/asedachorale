HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1 O Saviour, Who for man hast trod <br> The winepress of the wrath of God, <br> Ascend, and claim again on high <br> Thy glory, left for us to die. <br> <br>2 A radiant cloud is now Thy seat, <br> And earth lies stretched beneath Thy feet; <br> Ten thousand thousands round Thee sing, <br> And share the triumph of their King. <br> <br>3 The angel-host enraptured waits: <br> "Lift up your heads, eternal gates!" <br> O God and Man! the Father's throne <br> Is now for evermore Thine own. <br> <br>4 Our great High-Priest and Shepherd, Thou <br> Within the veil art entered now, <br> To offer there Thy precious blood <br> Once poured on earth, a cleansing flood. <br> <br>5 And thence the Church, Thy chosen bride, <br> With countless gifts of grace supplied, <br> Through all her members draws from Thee <br> Her hidden life of sanctity. <br> <br>6 O Christ our Lord, of Thy dear care <br> Thy lowly members heaven-ward bear; <br> Be ours with Thee to suffer pain, <br> With Thee for evermore to reign. <br> Amen. <br> The Hymnal: revised and enlarged as adopted by the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America in the year of our Lord <br>1892</p>
