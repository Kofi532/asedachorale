HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1. Above the starry spheres, <br> To where He was before, <br> Christ had gone up, the Fathers gift <br> Upon the Church to pour. <br> <br>2. At length had fully come, <br> On mystic circle borne <br> Of seven times seven revolving days, <br> The Pentecostal morn. <br> <br>3. When, as the Apostles knelt <br> At the third hour in prayer, <br> A sudden rushing sound proclaimed <br> That God Himself was there. <br> <br>4. Forthwith a tongue of fire <br> Is seen on every brow, <br> Each heart receives the Fathers light, <br> The Words enkindling glow. <br> <br>5. The Holy Ghost on all <br> Is mightily outpoured, <br> Who straight in divers tongues declare <br> The wonders of the Lord. <br> <br>6. While strangers of all climes <br> Flock round from far and near, <br> And their own tongue, wherever born, <br> All with amazement hear. <br> <br>7. But Judah, faithless still, <br> Denies the hand divine; <br> And, mocking, jeers the saints of Christ <br> As full of new made wine. <br> <br>8. Till Peter, in the midst, <br> By Joels ancient word, <br> Rebukes their unbelief, and wins <br> Three thousand to the Lord. <br> <br>9. The Father and the Son <br> And Spirit we adore, <br> O may the Spirits gifts be poured <br> On us forevermore. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>18</p>
