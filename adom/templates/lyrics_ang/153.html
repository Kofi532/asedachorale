        <p><br>1 Joy because the circling year <br> Brings our day of blessings here; <br> Day when first the Light divine <br> On the Church began to shine. <br> Alleluia! <br> <br>2 Like to quiv'ring tongues of flame <br> Unto each the Spirit came: <br> Tongues that each might hear their call; <br> Fire, that love might burn in all. <br> Alleluia! <br> <br>3 So the wondrous works of God <br> Wondrously were spread abroad; <br> Every tribe's familiar tone <br> Made the glorious marvel known. <br> Alleluia! <br> <br>4 Still the Spirit's fullness, Lord, <br> On Thy waiting Church be poured! <br> Once Thou on Thy Church did shower <br> Mighty signs and words of power; <br> Alleluia! <br> <br>5 Humbler things we ask Thee now, <br> Gifts of heaven to men below; <br> Grant our burdened heart release, <br> Grant Thine own abiding peace. <br> Alleluia! <br>  <br> Source: The Church Hymnal: containing hymns approved and set forth by the general conventions of <br>1892 and <br>1916; together with hymns for the use of guilds and brotherhoods, and for special occasions (Rev. ed) #<br>616</p>
