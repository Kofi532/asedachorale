        <p><br>1 Come, thou Holy Spirit, come, <br> and from thy celestial home <br> shed a ray of light divine; <br> come, thou Father of the poor, <br> come, thou source of all our store, <br> come, within our hearts to shine.<br>2 Thou of comforters the best, <br> thou the soul's most welcome guest, <br> sweet refreshment here below; <br> in our labour rest most sweet, <br> grateful coolness in the heat, <br> solace in the midst of woe.<br>3 O most bless√®d Light divine, <br> shine within these hearts of thine, <br> and our inmost being fill; <br> where thou art not, man hath naught, <br> nothing good in deed or thought, <br> nothing free from taint of ill.<br>4 Heal our wounds; our strength renew; <br> on our dryness pour thy dew; <br> wash the stains of guilt away; <br> bend the stubborn heart and will; <br> melt the frozen, warm the chill; <br> guide the steps that go astray.<br>5 On the faithful, who adore <br> and confess thee, evermore <br> in thy sevenfold gifts descend: <br> Give them virtue's sure reward, <br> give them thy salvation, Lord, <br> give them joys that never end. <br>  <br> Source: Ancient and Modern: hymns and songs for refreshing worship #<br>243</p>
