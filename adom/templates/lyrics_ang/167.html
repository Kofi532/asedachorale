HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1 O worship the King all-glorious above, <br> O gratefully sing his power and his love: <br> our shield and defender, the Ancient of Days, <br> pavilioned in splendor and girded with praise. <br> <br>2 O tell of his might and sing of his grace, <br> whose robe is the light, whose canopy space. <br> His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form, <br> and dark is his path on the wings of the storm. <br> <br>3 Your bountiful care, what tongue can recite? <br> It breathes in the air, it shines in the light; <br> it streams from the hills, it descends to the plain, <br> and sweetly distills in the dew and the rain. <br> <br>4 Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail, <br> in you do we trust, nor find you to fail. <br> Your mercies, how tender, how firm to the end, <br> our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend! <br> <br>5 O measureless Might, unchangeable Love, <br> whom angels delight to worship above! <br> Your ransomed creation, with glory ablaze, <br> in true adoration shall sing to your praise! <br> Psalter Hymnal, (Gray)</p>
