        <p><br>1 Jesus is God! the solid earth, <br> The ocean broad and bright, <br> The countless stars, like golden dust <br> That strew the skies at night; <br> The wheeling storm, the dreadful fire, <br> The pleasant, wholesome air, <br> The summer's sun, the winter's frost, <br> His own creations were. <br> <br>2 Jesus is God! the glorious bands <br> Of golden angels sing <br> Songs of adoring praise to Him, <br> Their Maker and their King. <br> He was true God in Bethlehem's crib, <br> On Calvary's Cross true God; <br> He who in heaven eternal reigned, <br> In time on earth abode. <br> <br>3 Jesus is God! there never was <br> A time when He was not: <br> Boundless, eternal, merciful, <br> The Word the Sire begot! <br> Backward our thoughts through ages stretch, <br> Onward through endless bliss,-- <br> For there are two eternities, <br> And both alike are His! <br> <br>4 Jesus is God! let sorrow come, <br> And pain, and every ill; <br> All are worth while, for all are means <br> His glory to fulfil! <br> Worth while a thousand years of life <br> To speak one little word, <br> If by our Credo we might own <br> The Godhead of our Lord! <br> <br>5 Jesus is God! if on the earth <br> This blessed faith decays, <br> More tender must our love become, <br> More plentiful our praise; <br> We are not angels, but we may <br> Down in earth's corners kneel, <br> And multiply sweet acts of love, <br> And murmur what we feel. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Laudis Corona: the new Sunday school hymn book, containing a collection of Catholic hymns, arranged for the principal seasons and festivals of the year #<br>150</p>
