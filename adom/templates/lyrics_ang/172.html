        <p><br>1 Praise to the Holiest in the height, <br> and in the depth be praise: <br> in all his words most wonderful, <br> most sure in all his ways. <br> <br>2 O loving wisdom of our God! <br> When all was sin and shame, <br> a second Adam to the fight <br> and to the rescue came. <br> <br>3 O wisest love! that flesh and blood, <br> which did in Adam fail, <br> should strive afresh against the foe, <br> should strive and should prevail; <br> <br>4 And that a higher gift than grace <br> should flesh and blood refine, <br> God's presence and his very self, <br> and essence all-divine. <br> <br>5 O generous love! that he, who smote <br> in Man for man the foe, <br> the double agony in Man <br> for man should undergo; <br> <br>6 And in the garden secretly, <br> and on the cross on high, <br> should teach his brethren, and inspire <br> to suffer and to die. <br> <br>7 Praise to the Holiest in the height, <br> and in the depth be praise: <br> in all his words most wonderful, <br> most sure in all his ways. <br>  <br> Source: Ancient and Modern: hymns and songs for refreshing worship #<br>763a</p>
