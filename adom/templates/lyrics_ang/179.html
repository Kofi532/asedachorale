        <p><br>1 To the name of our salvation <br> laud and honour let us pay, <br> which for many a generation <br> hid in God's foreknowledge lay, <br> but with holy exultation <br> we may sing aloud to-day.<br>2 Jesus is the name we treasure, <br> name beyond what words can tell; <br> name of gladness, name of pleasure, <br> ear and heart delighting well; <br> name of sweetness passing measure, <br> saving us from sin and hell.<br>3 'Tis the name that whoso preacheth <br> speaks like music to the ear; <br> who in prayer this name beseecheth <br> sweetest comfort findeth near; <br> who its perfect wisdom reacheth <br> heavenly joy possesseth here.<br>4 Jesus is the name exalted <br> over every other name; <br> in this name, whene'er assaulted, <br> we can put our foes to shame: <br> strength to them who else had halted, <br> eyes to blind, and feet to lame.<br>5 Therefore we in love adoring <br> this most blessed name revere, <br> holy Jesu, thee imploring <br> so to write it in us here, <br> that hereafter heavenward soaring <br> we may sing with angels there. <br>  <br> Source: Ancient and Modern: hymns and songs for refreshing worship #<br>819</p>
