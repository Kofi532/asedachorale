        <p><br>1 O love divine, how sweet thou art! <br> When shall I find my longing heart <br> all taken up by thee? <br> I thirst, I faint, I die to prove <br> the greatness of redeeming love, <br> the love of Christ to me.<br>2 Stronger his love than death or hell; <br> its riches are unsearchable: <br> the first-born sons of light <br> desire in vain its depth to see; <br> they cannot reach the mystery, <br> the length and breadth and height.<br>3 God only knows the love of God; <br> O that it now were shed abroad <br> in this poor stony heart! <br> For love I sigh, for love I pine; <br> this only portion, Lord, be mine, <br> be mine this better part.<br>4 For ever would I take my seat <br> with Mary at the Master's feet: <br> be this my happy choice; <br> my only care, delight, and bliss, <br> my joy, my heaven on earth, be this, <br> to hear the Bridegroom's voice!<br>5 Thy only love do I require, <br> nothing on earth beneath desire, <br> nothing in heaven above: <br> let earth and heaven, and all things go, <br> give me thine only love to know, <br> give me thine only love. <br>  <br> Source: Ancient and Modern: hymns and songs for refreshing worship #<br>751</p>
