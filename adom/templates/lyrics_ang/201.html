        <p><br>1 Where high the heavenly temple stands, <br> the house of God not made with hands, <br> a great High-Priest our nature wears, <br> the guardian of mankind appears. <br> <br>2 He who for men their surety stood, <br> and poured on earth his precious blood, <br> pursues in heaven his mighty plan, <br> the Saviour and the friend of man. <br> <br>3 Though now ascended up on high, <br> he bends on earth a brother's eye; <br> partaker of the human name, <br> he knows the frailty of our frame. <br> <br>4 Our fellow-suff'rer yet retains <br> a fellow-feeling of our pains; <br> and still remembers in the skies <br> his tears, his agonies, and cries. <br> <br>5 In every pang that rends the heart <br> the Man of Sorrows had a part; <br> he sympathizes with our grief, <br> and to the sufferer sends relief. <br> <br>6 With boldness therefore at the throne, <br> let us make all our sorrows known; <br> and ask the aid of heavenly power <br> to help us in the evil hour. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>562</p>
