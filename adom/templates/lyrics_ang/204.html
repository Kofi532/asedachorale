        <p><br>1 O quickly come, dread Judge of all; <br> for, awful though thine advent be, <br> all shadows from the truth will fall, <br> and falsehood die, in sight of thee: <br> O quickly come, for doubt and fear <br> like clouds dissolve when thou art near. <br> <br>2 O quickly come, great King of all; <br> reign all around us and within; <br> let sin no more our souls enthrall, <br> let pain and sorrow die with sin: <br> O quickly come, for thou alone <br> canst make thy scattered people one. <br> <br>3 O quickly come, true Life of all, <br> for death is mighty all around; <br> on ev'ry home his shadows fall, <br> on ev'ry heart his mark is found: <br> O quickly come, for grief and pain <br> can never cloud thy glorious reign. <br> <br>4 O quickly come, sure Light of all, <br> for gloomy night broods o'er our way; <br> and weakly souls begin to fall <br> with weary watching for the day: <br> O quickly come, for round thy throne <br> no eye is blind, no night is known. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Trinity Hymnal (Rev. ed.) #<br>322</p>
