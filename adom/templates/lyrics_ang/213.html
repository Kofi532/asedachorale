HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1. A living stream, as crystal clear, <br> Welling from out the throne, <br> Of God and of the Lamb on high, <br> The Lord to man hath shown. <br> <br>2. This stream doth water Paradise, <br> It makes the angels sing: <br> One precious drop within the heart <br> Is of all joy the spring: <br> <br>3. Joy past all speech, of glory full, <br> But stored where none may know, <br> As manna hid in dewy heaven, <br> As pearls in ocean low. <br> <br>4. Eye hath not seen, nor ear hath heard, <br> Nor to mans heart hath come <br> What for those loving Thee in truth <br> Thou hast in loves own home. <br> <br>5. But by His Spirit He to us <br> The secret doth reveal: <br> Faith sees and hears: but O for wings <br> That we might taste, and feel; <br> <br>6. Wings like a dove to waft us on <br> High oer the flood of sin! <br> Lord of the Ark, put forth Thine hand, <br> And take Thy wanderers in. <br> <br>7. O praise the Father, praise the Son, <br> The Lamb for sinners given, <br> And Holy Ghost, through whom alone <br> Our hearts are raised to Heavn. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>4023</p>
