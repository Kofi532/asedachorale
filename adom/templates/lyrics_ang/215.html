        <p><br>1 The church's one foundation <br> is Jesus Christ, her Lord; <br> she is His new creation, <br> by water and the word. <br> From heav'n He came and sought her <br> to be His holy bride; <br> with His own blood He bought her, <br> and for her life He died. <br> <br>2 Elect from every nation, <br> yet one o'er all the earth, <br> her charter of salvation: <br> one Lord, one faith, one birth. <br> One holy name she blesses, <br> partakes one holy food, <br> and to one hope she presses, <br> with every grace endued. <br> <br>3 Though with a scornful wonder, <br> men see her sore oppressed, <br> by schisms rent asunder, <br> by heresies distressed, <br> yet saints their watch are keeping, <br> their cry goes up, "How long?" <br> and soon the night of weeping <br> shall be the morn of song! <br> <br>4 The church shall never perish! <br> Her dear Lord to defend, <br> to guide, sustain, and cherish, <br> is with her to the end; <br> though there be those that hate her, <br> and false sons in her pale, <br> against the foe or traitor <br> she ever shall prevail. <br> <br>5 'Mid toil and tribulation, <br> and tumult of her war, <br> she waits the consummation <br> of peace forevermore; <br> till with the vision glorious <br> her longing eyes are blest, <br> and the great church victorious <br> shall be the church at rest. <br> <br>6 Yet she on earth hath union <br> with God the Three in One, <br> and mystic sweet communion <br> with those whose rest is won; <br> O happy ones and holy! <br> Lord give us grace that we, <br> like them, the meek and lowly, <br> on high may dwell with Thee. <br>  <br> Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God #<br>385</p>
