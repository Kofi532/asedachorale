        <p><br>1 Ten thousand times ten thousand <br> In sparkling raiment bright, <br> The armies of the ransomed saints <br> Throng up the steeps of light: <br> 'Tis finished, all is finished, <br> Their fight with death and sin; <br> Fling open wide the golden gates, <br> And let the victors in. <br> <br>2 What rush of alleluias <br> Fills all the earth and sky! <br> What ringing of a thousand harps <br> Bespeaks the triumph nigh! <br> O day, for which creation <br> And all its tribes were made; <br> O joy, for all its former woes <br> A thousandfold repaid! <br> <br>3 O then what raptured greetings <br> On Canaan's happy shore! <br> What knitting severed friendships up, <br> Where partings are no more! <br> Then eyes with joy shall sparkle <br> That brimmed with tears of late, <br> Orphans no longer fatherless, <br> Nor widows desolate. <br> <br>4 Bring near Thy great salvation, <br> Thou Lamb for sinners slain; <br> Fill up the roll of Thine elect, <br> Then take Thy power and reign; <br> Appear, Desire of nations, <br> Thine exiles long for home; <br> Show in the heavens Thy promised sign; <br> Thou Prince and Savior, come. <br> Amen. <br>  <br> Source: African Methodist Episcopal Church Hymnal #<br>499</p>
