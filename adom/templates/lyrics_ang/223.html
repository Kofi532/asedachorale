        <p><br>1 Hark, hark, my soul! Angelic songs are swelling <br> Oer earths green fields and oceans wave-beat shore; <br> How sweet the truth those blessed strains are telling <br> Of that new life when sin shall be no more. <br> Refrain: <br> Angels of Jesus, Angels of light, <br> Singing to welcome the pilgrims of the night. <br> <br>2 Onward we go, for still we hear them singing: <br> Come, weary souls, for Jesus bids you come; <br> And through the dark, its echoes sweetly ringing, <br> The music of the gospel leads us home. [Refrain] <br> <br>3 Far, far away, like bells at evening pealing, <br> The voice of Jesus sounds o'er land and sea, <br> And laden souls by thousands meekly stealing, <br> Kind Shepherd, turn their weary steps to Thee. [Refrain] <br> <br>4 Angels, sing on, your faithful watches keeping; <br> Sing us sweet fragments of the songs above, <br> Till mornings joy shall end the night of weeping, <br> And lifes long shadows break in cloudless love. [Refrain] <br>  <br> Source: African Methodist Episcopal Church Hymnal #<br>485</p>
