        <p><br>1 The world is very evil, <br> The times are waxing late; <br> Be sober and keep vigil, <br> The Judge is at the gate; <br> The Judge that comes in mercy, <br> The Judge that comes with might, <br> To terminate the evil, <br> To diadem the right. <br> <br>2 Arise, arise, good Christian, <br> Let right to wrong succeed; <br> Let penitential sorrow <br> To heav'nly gladness lead <br> To light that hath no evening, <br> That knows no moon nor sun, <br> The light so new and golden, <br> The light that is but one. <br> <br>3 Brief life is here our portion; <br> Brief sorrow, short-lived care; <br> The life that knows no ending, <br> The tearless life, is there. <br> O happy retribution: <br> Short toil, eternal rest; <br> For mortals and for sinners <br> A mansion with the blest! <br> <br>4 And now we light the battle, <br> But then shall wear the crown <br> Of full and everlasting <br> And passionless renown; <br> And now we watch and struggle, <br> And now we live in hope, <br> And Zion in her anguish <br> With Babylon must cope. <br> <br>5 But He whom now we trust in <br> Shall then be seen and known; <br> And they that know and see Him <br> Shall have Him for their own. <br> And there is David's fountain <br> And life in fullest glow; <br> And there the light is golden, <br> And milk and honey flow. <br> <br>6 O home of fadeless splendor, <br> Of flow'rs that bear no thorn, <br> Where they shall dwell as children <br> Who here as exiles mourn. <br> Midst pow'r that knows no limit, <br> Where knowledge has no bound, <br> The beatific vision <br> Shall glad the saints around. <br> <br>7 Jerusalem the golden, <br> With milk and honey blessed, <br> Beneath thy contemplation <br> Sink heart and voice oppressed. <br> I know not, O I know not, <br> What joys await us there, <br> What radiancy of glory, <br> What bliss beyond compare. <br> <br>8 They stand, those halls of Zion, <br> All jubilant with song <br> And bright with many an angel <br> And all the martyr throng. <br> The Prince is ever in them; <br> The daylight is serene; <br> The pastures of the blessed <br> Are decked in glorious sheen. <br> <br>9 There is the throne of David; <br> And there, from care released, <br> The shout of them that triumph, <br> The song of them that feast; <br> And they who with their Leader <br> Have conquered in the fight <br> Forever and forever <br> Are clad in robes of white. <br> <br>10 For thee, O dear, dear country, <br> Mine eyes their vigils keep; <br> For very love, beholding <br> Thy happy name, they weep. <br> The mention of thy glory <br> Is unction to the breast <br> And medicine in sickness <br> And love and life and rest. <br> <br>11 O one, O only mansion, <br> O Paradise of joy, <br> Where tears are ever banished <br> And smiles have no alloy! <br> The Lamb is all thy splendor, <br> The Crucified thy praise; <br> His laud and benediction <br> Thy ransomed people raise. <br> <br>12 With jasper glow thy bulwarks, <br> Thy streets with em'ralds blaze; <br> The sardius and the topaz <br> Unite in thee their rays; <br> Thine ageless walls are bonded <br> With amethyst unpriced; <br> The saints build up thy fabric, <br> The cornerstone is Christ. <br> <br>13 Thou hast no shore, fair ocean; <br> Thou hast no time, bright day, <br> Dear fountain of refreshment <br> To pilgrims far away! <br> Upon the Rock of Ages <br> they raise thy holy tower; <br> Thine is the victor's laurel <br> And thine the golden dower. <br> <br>14 O sweet and blessed country, <br> The home of God's elect! <br> O sweet and blessed country <br> That eager hearts expect! <br> Jesus, in mercy bring us <br> To that dear land of rest, <br> Who art, with God the Father <br> And Spirit, ever blest. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Evangelical Lutheran Hymnary #<br>534</p>
