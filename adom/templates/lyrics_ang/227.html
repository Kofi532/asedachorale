        <p><br>1 For thee, O dear country, <br> Mine eyes their vigils keep; <br> For very love beholding <br> Thy holy name, they weep. <br> The mention of thy glory <br> Is unction to the breast, <br> And medicine in sickness, <br> And love, and life, and rest <br> <br>2 O one, O only mansion! <br> O Paradise of joy! <br> Where tears are ever banishd <br> And smiles have no alloy; <br> Thy loveliness oppresses <br> All human thought and heart, <br> And none, O Peace, O SIon, <br> Can sing thee as thou art. <br> <br>3 With jasper glow thy bulwarks, <br> Thy streets with emeralds blaze; <br> The sardius and the topaz <br> Unite in thee their rays; <br> Thine ageless walls are bonded <br> With amethyst unpriced; <br> The saints shall build thy fabric, <br> And the cornerstone is Christ. <br> <br>4 The cross is all thy splendor, <br> The Crucified thy praise; <br> His laud and benediction <br> Thy ransomd saints shall raise; <br> Upon the Rock of Ages <br> They build thy holy tower; <br> Thine is the victor's laurel, <br> And thine the golden dower. <br> <br>5 O sweet and blessed country, <br> The home of Gods elect! <br> O sweet and blessed country <br> That eager hearts expect! <br> Jesus, in mercy bring us <br> To that dear land of rest, <br> Who art, with God the Father, <br> And Spirit, ever blest. <br>  <br> Source: Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal #<br>424</p>
