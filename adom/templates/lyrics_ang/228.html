        <p><br>1 Jerusalem the golden, <br> with milk and honey blest, <br> beneath your contemplation <br> sink heart and voice oppressed; <br> I know not, O I know not <br> what joys await me there, <br> what radiancy of glory, <br> what bliss beyond compare! <br> <br>2 They stand, those halls of Zion, <br> all jubilant with song, <br> and bright with many an angel, <br> and all the martyr throng; <br> the Prince is ever in them; <br> the daylight is serene; <br> the pastures of the blessed <br> are decked in glorious sheen. <br> <br>3 There is the throne of David; <br> and there, from care released, <br> the shout of those who triumph, <br> the song of those who feast; <br> and they, who with their Leader <br> have conquered in the fight, <br> forever and forever <br> are clad in robes of white. <br> <br>4 O sweet and blessed country, <br> the home of God's elect! <br> O sweet and blessed country, <br> that eager hearts expect! <br> In mercy, Jesus, bring us <br> to that dear land of rest, <br> who are, with God the Father, <br> and Spirit, ever blessed. <br>  <br> Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God #<br>419</p>
