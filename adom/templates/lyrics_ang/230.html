HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1 There is a blessed home beyond this land of woe, <br> Where trials never come, nor tears of sorrow flow; <br> Where faith is fully lost in sight, and patient hope is crowned, <br> And everlasting light its glory casts around. <br> <br>2 There is a land of peace, good angels know it well; <br> Glad songs that never cease within its portals swell. <br> Around the glorious throne of God the countless saints adore <br> Christ, with the Father one, and Spirit evermore. <br> <br>3 O joy all joys beyond, to see the Lamb who died, <br> And count each sacred wound in hands and feet and side; <br> To give to him eternal praise for evÂ’ry triumph won, <br> And sing through endless days the great things he has done! <br> <br>4 Look up, you saints of God, nor fear to tread below <br> The path your Savior trod of daily toil and woe: <br> Wait only for a little while in uncomplaining love. <br> His own most gracious smile will welcome you above. <br>  <br> Source: Christian Worship (<br>2008): supplement #<br>729</p>
