        <p><br>1 Light's abode, celestial Salem, <br> vision whence true peace doth spring, <br> brighter than the heart can fancy, <br> mansion of the highest King; <br> O how glorious are the praises <br> which of thee the prophets sing!<br>2 There for ever and for ever <br> alleluia is outpoured; <br> for unending, for unbroken, <br> is the feast-day of the Lord; <br> all is pure and all is holy <br> that within thy walls is stored.<br>3 There no cloud or passing vapour <br> dims the brightness of the air; <br> endless noon-day, glorious noon-day, <br> from the Sun of suns is there; <br> there no night brings rest from labour, <br> for unknown are toil and care.<br>4 O how glorious and resplendent, <br> fragile body, shalt thou be, <br> when endued with so much beauty, <br> full of health and strong and free, <br> full of vigour, full of pleasure <br> that shall last eternally.<br>5 Now with gladness, now with courage, <br> bear the burden on thee laid, <br> that hereafter these thy labours <br> may with endless gifts be paid; <br> and in everlasting glory <br> thou with brightness be arrayed.<br>6 Laud and honour to the Father, <br> laud and honour to the Son, <br> laud and honour to the Spirit, <br> ever Three and ever One, <br> consubstantial, co-eternal, <br> while unending ages run. <br>  <br> Source: Ancient and Modern: hymns and songs for refreshing worship #<br>710</p>
