        <p><br>1 Jerusalem on high, <br> my song that city is, <br> my home wheneer I die, <br> the center of my bliss: <br> O happy place! <br> When shall I be, <br> my God, with thee, <br> to see thy face? <br> <br>2 There dwells my Lord, my King, <br> judged here unfit to live; <br> there angels to him sing, <br> and lowly homage give: <br> O happy place! <br> When shall I be, <br> my God, with thee, <br> to see thy face? <br> <br>3 The patriarchs of old <br> there from their travels cease; <br> the prophets there behold <br> their longed-for Prince of Peace. <br> O happy place! <br> When shall I be, <br> my God, with thee, <br> to see thy face? <br> <br>4 The Lambs apostles there <br> I might with joy behold, <br> the harpers I might hear <br> harping on harps of gold: <br> O happy place! <br> When shall I be, <br> my God, with thee, <br> to see thy face? <br> <br>5 The bleeding martyrs, they <br> within those courts are found, <br> clothèd in pure array, <br> their scars with glory crowned; <br> O happy place! <br> When shall I be, <br> my God, with thee, <br> to see thy face? <br> <br>6 Ah me! Ah me! That I <br> in Kedars tent here stay; <br> no place like that on high; <br> Lord, thither guide my way: <br> O happy place! <br> When shall I be, <br> my God, with thee, <br> to see thy face? <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>402</p>
