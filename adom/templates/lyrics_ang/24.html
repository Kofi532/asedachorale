        <p><br>1 Sun of my soul, Thou Savior dear, <br> it is not night if Thou be near; <br> O may no earthborn cloud arise, <br> to hide Thee from Thy servant's eyes. <br> <br>2 When the soft dews of kindly sleep <br> my weary eyelids gently steep, <br> be my last thought how sweet to rest <br> forever on my Savior's breast. <br> <br>3 Abide with me from morn till eve, <br> for without Thee I cannot live; <br> abide with me when night is nigh, <br> for without Thee I dare not die. <br> <br>4 If some poor wand'ring child of Thine <br> has spurned today the voice divine, <br> now, Lord, the gracious work begin; <br> let him no more lie down in sin. <br> <br>5 Watch by the sick; enrich the poor <br> with blessings from Thy boundless store; <br> be every mourner's sleep tonight <br> like infant's slumbers, pure and light. <br> <br>6 Come near and bless us when we wake, <br> ere through the world our way we take, <br> till in the ocean of Thy love <br> we lose ourselves in heav'n above. <br>  <br> Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God #<br>413</p>
