        <p><br>1 Pleasant are Thy courts above <br> In the land of light and love; <br> Pleasant are Thy courts below <br> In this land of sin and woe. <br> O my spirit longs and faints <br> For the converse of Thy saints, <br> For the brightness of Thy face, <br> For Thy fullness, God of grace. <br> <br>2 Happy birds that sing and fly <br> Round Thy altars, O Most High; <br> Happier souls that find a rest <br> In a heavenly Father's breast! <br> Like the wandering dove that found <br> No repose on earth around, <br> They can to their ark repair <br> And enjoy it ever there. <br> <br>3 Happy souls, their praises flow <br> Even in this vale of woe; <br> Waters in the desert rise, <br> Manna feeds them from the skies; <br> On they go from strength to strength <br> Till they reach Thy throne at length, <br> At Thy feet adoring fall, <br> Who hast led them safe through all. <br> <br>4 Lord, be mine this prize to win; <br> Guide me through a world of sin, <br> Keep me by Thy saving grace, <br> Give me at Thy side a place. <br> Sun and shield alike Thou art; <br> Guide and guard my erring heart. <br> Grace and glory flow from Thee; <br> Shower, O shower them, Lord, on me. <br> Amen. <br>  <br> Source: African Methodist Episcopal Church Hymnal #<br>523</p>
