HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1 When at Thy footstool, Lord, I bend, <br> And plead with Thee for mercy there, <br> Think of the sinner's dying Friend, <br> And for His sake receive my prayer. <br> <br>2 Oh, think not of my shame and guilt, <br> My thousand stains of deepest dye! <br> Think of the blood which Jesus spilt, <br> And let that blood my pardon buy. <br> <br>3 Think, Lord, how I am still Thine own, <br> The trembling creature of Thy hand; <br> Think how my heart to sin is prone, <br> And what temptations round me stand. <br> <br>4 Oh, think upon Thy holy Word, <br> And every plighted promise there! <br> How prayer should evermore be heard, <br> And how Thy glory is to spare. <br> <br>5 Oh, think not of my doubts and fears, <br> My strivings with Thy grace divine; <br> Think upon Jesus' woes and tears, <br> And let His merits stand for mine. <br> <br>6 Thine eye, Thine ear, they are not dull; <br> Thine arm can never shortened be; <br> Behold me here; my heart is full; <br> Behold, and spare, and succor me. <br> The Hymnal: revised and enlarged as adopted by the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America in the year of our Lord <br>1892</p>
