        <p><br>1 I was a wand'ring sheep, <br> I did not love the fold; <br> I did not love my Shepherd's voice, <br> I would not be controlled. <br> I was a wayward child, <br> I did not love my home; <br> I did not love my Father's voice, <br> I loved afar to roam. <br> <br>2 The Shepherd sought his sheep, <br> the Father sought his child; <br> they followed me o'er vale and hill, <br> o'er deserts waste and wild: <br> they found me nigh to death, <br> famished and faint and lone; <br> they bound me with the bands of love, <br> they saved the wand'ring one. <br> <br>3 Jesus my Shepherd is; <br> 'twas he that loved my soul, <br> 'twas he that washed me in his blood, <br> 'twas he that made me whole; <br> 'twas he that sought the lost, <br> that found the wand'ring sheep, <br> 'twas he that brought me to the fold, <br> 'tis he that still doth keep. <br> <br>4 I was a wand'ring sheep, <br> I would not be controlled; <br> but now I love my Shepherd's voice, <br> I love, I love the fold. <br> I was a wayward child, <br> I once preferred to roam; <br> but now I love my Father's voice, <br> I love, I love his home. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Trinity Hymnal (Rev. ed.) #<br>464</p>
