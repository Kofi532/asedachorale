        <p><br>1 O Lord, how happy should we be <br> If we could cast our care on Thee, <br> If we from self could rest, <br> And feel at heart that One above, <br> In perfect wisdom, perfect love, <br> Is working for the best! <br> <br>2 How far from this our daily life, <br> Ever disturbed by anxious strife, <br> By sudden, wild alarms! <br> O could, we but relinquish all <br> Our earthly props, and simply fall <br> On Thy almighty arms! <br> <br>3 Could we but kneel and cast our load, <br> E'en while we pray, upon our God, <br> Then rise with lightened cheer, <br> Sure that the Father, who is nigh <br> To still the famished raven's cry, <br> Will hear in that we fear! <br> <br>4 Lord, make these faithless hearts of ours <br> Such lesson learns from birds and flowers; <br> Make them from self to cease, <br> Leave all things to a Father's will, <br> And taste, before Him lying still, <br> E'en in affliction, peace. <br>  <br> Source: The Church Hymnal: containing hymns approved and set forth by the general conventions of <br>1892 and <br>1916; together with hymns for the use of guilds and brotherhoods, and for special occasions (Rev. ed) #<br>345</p>
