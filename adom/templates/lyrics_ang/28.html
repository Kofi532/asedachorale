        <p><br>1 O Saviour, bless us ere we go; <br> thy word into our minds instil, <br> and make our lukewarm hearts to glow <br> with lowly love and fervent will. <br> Through life's long day and death's dark night, <br> O gentle Jesus, be our Light. <br> <br>2 The day is done, its hours have run, <br> and thou hast taken count of all, <br> the scanty triumphs grace hath won, <br> the broken vow, the frequent fall. <br> Through life's long day and death's dark night, <br> O gentle Jesus, be our Light. <br> <br>3 Grant us, dear Lord, from evil ways <br> true absolution and release; <br> and bless us, more than in past days, <br> with purity and inward peace. <br> Through life's long day and death's dark night, <br> O gentle Jesus, be our Light. <br> <br>4 Do more than pardon; give us joy, <br> sweet fear and sober liberty, <br> and simple hearts without alloy <br> that only long to be like thee. <br> Through life's long day and death's dark night, <br> O gentle Jesus, be our Light. <br> <br>5 For all we love, the poor, the sad, <br> the sinful, unto thee we call; <br> O let thy mercy make us glad: <br> thou art our Jesus, and our All. <br> Through life's long day and death's dark night, <br> O gentle Jesus, be our Light. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>24</p>
