        <p><br>1 Jesus, Lord of life and glory, <br> bend from heav'n thy gracious ear; <br> while our waiting souls adore thee, <br> Friend of helpless sinners, hear: <br> Refrain: <br> by thy mercy, O deliver us, good Lord. <br> <br>2 From the depth of nature's blindness, <br> from the hard'ning pow'r of sin, <br> from all malice and unkindness, <br> from the pride that lurks within, [Refrain] <br> <br>3 When temptation sorely presses, <br> In the day of Satan's pow'r, <br> In our times of deep distresses, <br> In each dark and trying hour, [Refrain] <br> <br>4 When the world around is smiling, <br> in the time of wealth and ease, <br> earthly joys our hearts beguiling, <br> in the day of health and peace, [Refrain] <br> <br>5 In our weary hours of sickness, <br> in our times of grief and pain, <br> when we feel our mortal weakness, <br> when the creature's help is vain, [Refrain] <br> <br>6 In the solemn hour of dying, <br> in the awful Judgment Day, <br> may our souls, on thee relying, <br> find thee still our rock and stay: [Refrain] <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Trinity Hymnal (Rev. ed.) #<br>569</p>
