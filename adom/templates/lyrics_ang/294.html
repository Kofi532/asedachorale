        <p><br>1 O praise our great and gracious Lord, <br> and call upon his name; <br> to strains of joy tune every chord, <br> his mighty acts proclaim; <br> tell how he led his chosen race <br> to Canaans promised land; <br> tell how his covenant of grace <br> unchanged shall ever stand. <br> <br>2 He gave the shadowing cloud by day, <br> the moving fire by night; <br> to guide his Israel on their way, <br> he made their darkness light; <br> and have we not a sure retreat, <br> a Saviour ever nigh, <br> the same clear light to guide our feet, <br> the day-spring from on high? <br> <br>3 We too, have manna from above, <br> the bread that comes from heaven; <br> to us the same kind hand of love <br> hath living waters given; <br> a rock we have, from whence the spring <br> in rich abundance flows; <br> that rock is Christ, our Priest, our King, <br> who life and health bestows. <br> <br>4 O may we praise this blessèd food, <br> and trust our heavenly Guide; <br> so shall we find death's fearful flood <br> serene as Jordan's tide, <br> and safely reach that happy shore, <br> and land of peace and rest, <br> where angels worship and adore <br> in Gods own presence blest. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>374</p>
