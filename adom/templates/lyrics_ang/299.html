        <p><br>1 Come, let us join our cheerful songs <br> with angels round the throne; <br> ten thousand thousand are their tongues, <br> but all their joys are one.<br>2 'Worthy the Lamb that died,' they cry, <br> 'to be exalted thus'; <br> 'Worthy the Lamb,' our lips reply, <br> 'for he was slain for us.'<br>3 Jesus is worthy to receive <br> honour and power divine; <br> and blessings, more than we can give, <br> be, Lord, for ever thine.<br>4 Let all that dwell above the sky, <br> and air, and earth, and seas, <br> conspire to lift thy glories high, <br> and speak thine endless praise.<br>5 The whole creation joins in one <br> to bless the sacred name <br> of him that sits upon the throne, <br> and to adore the Lamb. <br>  <br> Source: Ancient and Modern: hymns and songs for refreshing worship #<br>362</p>
