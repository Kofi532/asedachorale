        <p><br>1 Come, ye faithful, raise the anthem, <br> cleave the skies with shouts of praise; <br> sing to him who found the ransom, <br> Ancient of eternal Days, <br> God of God, the Word incarnate, <br> whom the heaven of heaven obeys. <br> <br>2 Ere he raised the lofty mountains, <br> formed the seas, or built the sky, <br> love eternal, free, and boundless, <br> moved the Lord of life to die, <br> fore-ordained the Prince of princes <br> for the throne of Calvary. <br> <br>3 There, for us and our redemption, <br> see him all his life-blood pour! <br> There he wins our full salvation, <br> dies that we may die no more; <br> then, arising, lives for ever, <br> reigning where he was before. <br> <br>4 High on yon celestial mountains <br> stands his sapphire throne, all bright, <br> midst unending alleluias <br> bursting from the sons of light; <br> Zion's people tell his praises, <br> victor after hard-won fight. <br> <br>5 Bring your harps, and bring your incense, <br> sweep the string and pour the lay; <br> let the earth proclaim his wonders, <br> King of that celestial day; <br> he the Lamb once slain is worthy, <br> who was dead, and lives for ay. <br> <br>6 Laud and honour to the Father, <br> laud and honour to the Son, <br> laud and honour to the Spirit, <br> ever Three and ever One, <br> consubstantial, co-eternal, <br> while unending ages run. <br>  <br> Source: Ancient and Modern: hymns and songs for refreshing worship #<br>619</p>
