        <p><br>1 O Savior, precious Savior, <br> whom yet unseen we love, <br> O name of might and favor, <br> all other names above; <br> we worship you, we bless you, <br> to you alone we sing; <br> we praise you, and confess you <br> our holy Lord and King. <br> <br>2 O bringer of salvation, <br> who wondrously has wrought, <br> yourself the revelation <br> of love beyond our thought; <br> we worship you, we bless you, <br> to you alone we sing; <br> we praise you, and confess you <br> our gracious Lord and King. <br> <br>3 In you all fullness dwelling, <br> all grace and pow'r outpours: <br> the glory all-excelling, <br> O Son of God, is yours; <br> we worship you, we bless you, <br> to you alone we sing; <br> we praise you, and confess you <br> our glorious Lord and King. <br> <br>4 O grant the consummation <br> of this our song above <br> in endless adoration <br> and everlasting love; <br> then shall we praise and bless you <br> where perfect praises ring, <br> and evermore confess you <br> our Savior and our King. <br>  <br> Source: Trinity Psalter Hymnal #<br>263</p>
