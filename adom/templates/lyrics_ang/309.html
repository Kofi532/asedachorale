        <p><br>1 Now, my tongue, the mystery telling <br> of the glorious body sing, <br> and the blood, all price excelling, <br> which the Gentiles' Lord and King, <br> in a Virgin's womb once dwelling, <br> shed for this world's ransoming. <br> <br>2 Given for us, and condescending <br> to be born for us below, <br> he, with us in converse blending, <br> dwelt the seed of truth to sow, <br> till he closed with wondrous ending <br> his most patient life of woe. <br> <br>3 That last night, at supper lying, <br> 'mid the Twelve, his chosen band, <br> Jesus, with the law complying, <br> keeps the feast its rites demand; <br> then, more precious food supplying, <br> gives himself with his own hand. <br> <br>4 Word-made-flesh, true bread he maketh <br> by his word his flesh to be, <br> wine his blood; which whoso taketh <br> must from carnal thoughts be free: <br> faith alone, though sight forsaketh, <br> shows true hearts the mystery. <br> <br>5 Therefore we, before him bending, <br> this great sacrament revere: <br> types and shadows have their ending, <br> for the newer rite is here; <br> faith, our outward sense befriending, <br> makes our inward vision clear. <br> <br>6 Glory let us give and blessing <br> to the Father and the Son, <br> honour, might, and praise addressing, <br> while eternal ages run; <br> ever too his love confessing, <br> who, from both, with both is One. Amen. <br>  <br> Source: Ancient and Modern: hymns and songs for refreshing worship #<br>457</p>
