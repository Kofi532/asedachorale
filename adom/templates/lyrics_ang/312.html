        <p><br>1 Thee we adore, O hidden Savior, thee, <br> who at this blessed feast art pleased to be; <br> both flesh and spirit in thy presence fail, <br> yet here thy presence we devoutly hail. <br> <br>2 O blest memorial of our dying Lord, <br> who living bread to all doth here afford! <br> O may our souls forever feed on thee, <br> and thou, O Christ, forever precious be! <br> <br>3 Fountain of goodness, Jesus, Lord and God, <br> cleanse us, unclean, with thy most cleansing blood; <br> increase our faith and love, that we may know <br> the hope and peace which from thy presence flow. <br> <br>4 O Christ, whom now beneath a veil we see, <br> may what we thirst for soon our portion be, <br> to gaze on thee unveiled, and see thy face, <br> the vision of thy glory and thy grace. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Glory to God: the Presbyterian Hymnal #<br>495</p>
