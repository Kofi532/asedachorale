        <p><br>1 Once, only once, and once for all, <br> his precious life he gave; <br> before the cross our spirits fall, <br> and own it strong to save. <br> <br>2 'One off'ring, single and complete,' <br> with lips and hearts we say; <br> but what he never can repeat <br> he shows forth day by day. <br> <br>3 For, as the priest of AaronÂ’s line <br> within the holiest stood, <br> and sprinkled all the mercy-shrine <br> with sacrificial blood; <br> <br>4 so he who once atonement wrought, <br> our Priest of endless power, <br> presents himself for those he bought <br> in that dark noontide hour. <br> <br>5 His manhood pleads where now it lives <br> on heaven's eternal throne, <br> and where in mystic rite he gives <br> its presence to his own. <br> <br>6 And so we show thy death, O Lord, <br> till thou again appear; <br> and feel, when we approach thy board, <br> we have an altar here. <br> *<br>7 All glory to the Father be, <br> all glory to the Son, <br> all glory, Holy Ghost, to thee, <br> while endless ages run. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>617</p>
