        <p><br>1 And now the wants are told, that brought <br> thy children to thy knee; <br> here lingering still, we ask for naught, <br> but simply worship thee. <br> <br>2 The hope of heavens eternal days <br> absorbs not all the heart <br> that gives thee glory, love, and praise, <br> for being what thou art. <br> <br>3 For thou art God, the One, the Same, <br> oer all things high and bright; <br> and round us, when we speak thy name, <br> there spreads a heaven of light. <br> <br>4 O wondrous peace, in thought to dwell <br> on excellence Divine; <br> to know that nought in man can tell <br> how fair thy beauties shine! <br> <br>5 O thou, above all blessing blest, <br> oer thanks exalted far, <br> thy very greatness is a rest <br> to weaklings as we are; <br> <br>6 For when we feel the praise of thee <br> a task beyond our powers, <br> we say, 'a perfect God is he, <br> and he is fully ours.' <br> <br>7 All glory to the Father be, <br> all glory to the Son, <br> all glory, Holy Ghost, to thee, <br> while endless ages run. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>8</p>
