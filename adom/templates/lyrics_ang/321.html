        <p><br>1 We pray thee, heavenly Father, <br> to hear us in thy love, <br> and pour upon thy children <br> the unction from above; <br> that so in love abiding, <br> from all defilement free, <br> we may in pureness offer <br> our Eucharist to thee.<br>2 Be thou our guide and helper, <br> O Jesus Christ, we pray; <br> so may we well approach thee, <br> if thou wilt be the Way: <br> thou, very Truth, hast promised <br> to help us in our strife, <br> food of the weary pilgrim, <br> eternal source of Life.<br>3 And thou, creator Spirit, <br> look on us, we are thine; <br> renew in us thy graces, <br> upon our darkness shine; <br> that, with thy benediction <br> upon our souls outpoured, <br> we may receive in gladness <br> the body of the Lord.<br>4 O Trinity of Persons, <br> O Unity most high, <br> on thee alone relying <br> thy servants would draw nigh: <br> unworthy in our weakness, <br> on thee our hope is stayed, <br> and blessed by thy forgiveness <br> we will not be afraid. <br>  <br> Source: Ancient and Modern: hymns and songs for refreshing worship #<br>471</p>
