        <p><br>1 And now, O Father, mindful of the love <br> that bought us, once for all, on Calvary's tree, <br> and having with us him that pleads above, <br> we here present, we here spread forth to thee <br> that only offering perfect in thine eyes, <br> the one true, pure, immortal sacrifice.<br>2 Look, Father, look on his anointed face, <br> and only look on us as found in him; <br> look not on our misusings of thy grace, <br> our prayer so languid, and our faith so dim: <br> for lo, between our sins and their reward <br> we set the Passion of thy Son our Lord.<br>3 And then for those, our dearest and our best, <br> by this prevailing presence we appeal: <br> O fold them closer to thy mercy's breast, <br> O do thine utmost for their souls' true weal; <br> from tainting mischief keep them white and clear, <br> and crown thy gifts with strength to persevere.<br>4 And so we come: O draw us to thy feet, <br> most patient Saviour, who canst love us still; <br> and by this food, so aweful and so sweet, <br> deliver us from every touch of ill: <br> in thine own service make us glad and free, <br> and grant us never more to part with thee. <br>  <br> Source: Ancient and Modern: hymns and songs for refreshing worship #<br>423</p>
