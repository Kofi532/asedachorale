        <p>Substitute she/her for he/him if appropriate. <br> <br>1. Within the Churchs sacred fold, <br> By holy sacrament enrolled, <br> Another lamb we lay: <br> An heir before of sin and shame, <br> Now in the holy triune name <br> His guilt is washed away. <br> <br>2. O loving Father, Thee we pray <br> Look on this babe newborn today, <br> Thine own adopted child; <br> An angel guard do Thou bestow <br> To lead him in Thy paths below, <br> And guide him through the wild. <br> <br>3. O God the Son, Thou heavenly vine, <br> Protect this tender branch of Thine <br> Through all that may betide; <br> Forever nourished may he be <br> With sap divine that flows from Thee, <br> In Thee for aye abide. <br> <br>4. Blest Spirit, whose indwelling grace <br> Has given this little one a place <br> Among the heirs of life; <br> O breathe Thy sevenfold gifts within, <br> And keep Thy temple pure from sin <br> In midst of worldly strife. <br> <br>5. So, holy Trinity, by Thee <br> Divinely trained this babe may be <br> In faith and hope and love; <br> So may he gain, earths waves oerpast, <br> His bright inheritance at last <br> With all Thy saints above. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>7521</p>
