        <p><br>1. Tis done! that new and heavenly birth, <br> Which re-creates the sons of earth, <br> Has cleansed from guilt of Adams sin <br> A soul which Jesus died to win. <br> <br>2. Tis done! the cross upon the brow <br> Is marked for weal or sorrow now, <br> To shine with heavenly luster bright, <br> Or burn in everlasting night. <br> <br>3. O ye who came that babe to lay <br> Within a Saviors arms today, <br> Watch well and guard with careful eye <br> The heir of immortality. <br> <br>4. Teach him to know a Fathers love, <br> And seek for happiness above, <br> To Christ his heart and treasures give <br> And in the Spirit ever live. <br> <br>5. That so before the judgment seat <br> In joy and triumph ye may meet; <br> The battle fought, the struggle oer, <br> The kingdom yours forevermore. <br> <br>6. Praise God, from whom all blessings flow, <br> Praise Him, all creatures here below, <br> Praise Him above, angelic host, <br> Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>6519</p>
