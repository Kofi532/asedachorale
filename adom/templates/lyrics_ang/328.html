HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1 In token that thou shalt not fear <br> Christ crucified to own, <br> We print the cross upon thee here, <br> And stamp thee His alone. <br> <br>2 In token that thou shalt not blush <br> To glory in His Name, <br> We blazon here upon thy front <br> His glory and His shame. <br> <br>3 In token that thou shalt not flinch <br> Christ's quarrel to maintain, <br> But 'neath His banner manfully <br> Firm at thy post remain. <br> <br>4 In token that thou too shalt tread <br> The path He travell'd by, <br> Endure the cross, despise the shame, <br> And sit thee down on high; <br> <br>5 Thus outwardly and visibly <br> We seal thee for His own: <br> And may the brow that wears His cross <br> Hereafter share His crown. <br> Hymnal: according to the use of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America, <br>1871</p>
