        <p><br>1. Morn of morns, and day of days! <br> Beauteous were thy newborn rays: <br> Brighter yet from deathÂ’s dark prison <br> Christ, the Light of lights, is risen. <br> <br>2. He commanded, and His Word <br> Death and the dread chaos heard; <br> Oh, shall we, more deaf than they, <br> In the chains of darkness stay? <br> <br>3. Nature yet in shadow lies; <br> Let the sons of light arise, <br> And present the morning rays <br> With sweet canticles of praise. <br> <br>4. While the dead world sleeps around, <br> Let the sacred temples sound <br> Law, and prophet, and blest psalm <br> Lit with holy light so calm. <br> <br>5. Unto hearts in slumber weak <br> Let the heavenly trumpet speak; <br> And a newer walk express <br> Their new life to righteousness. <br> <br>6. Grant us this, and with us be, <br> O Thou fount of charity, <br> Thou who dost the Spirit give, <br> Bidding the dead letter live. <br> <br>7. Glory to the Father, Son, <br> And to Thee, O Holy One, <br> By whose quickening breath divine <br> Our dull spirits turn and shine. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>4323</p>
