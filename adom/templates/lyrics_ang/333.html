HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1. Christ, who once among us as a child did dwell, <br> Is the childrenÂ’s Savior, and He loves us well; <br> If we keep our promise made Him at the font, <br> He will be our Shepherd, and we shall not want. <br> <br>2. There it was they laid us in those tender arms, <br> Where the lambs are carried safe from all alarms; <br> If we trust His promise, He will let us rest <br> In His arms forever, leaning on His breast. <br> <br>3. Though we may not see Him for a little while, <br> We shall know He holds us, often feel His smile; <br> Death will be to slumber, in that sweet embrace, <br> And we shall awaken to behold His face. <br> <br>4. He will be our Shepherd after as before, <br> By still heavenly waters lead us evermore, <br> Make us lie in pastures beautiful and green, <br> Where none thirst or hunger, <br> And no tears are seen. <br> <br>5. Jesus, our good Shepherd, laying down Thy life, <br> Lest Thy sheep should perish in the cruel strife, <br> Help us to remember all Thy love and care, <br> Trust in Thee, and love Thee <br> Always, everywhere.</p>
