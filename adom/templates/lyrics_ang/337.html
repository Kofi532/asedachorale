        <p><br>1 Theres a Friend for little children <br> above the bright blue sky, <br> a Friend who never changes, <br> whose love will never die; <br> our earthly friends may fail us, <br> and change with changing years; <br> this Friend is always worthy <br> of that dear name he bears. <br> <br>2 Theres a rest for little children <br> above the bright blue sky, <br> who love the blessèd Saviour, <br> and to the Father cry: <br> a rest from every turmoil, <br> from sin and sorrow free, <br> where every little pilgrim <br> shall rest eternally. <br> <br>3 Theres a home for little children <br> above the bright blue sky, <br> where Jesus reigns in glory, <br> a home of peace and joy: <br> no home on earth is like it, <br> nor can with it compare; <br> for everyone is happy, <br> nor could be happier, there. <br> *<br>4 Theres a crown for little children <br> above the bright blue sky, <br> and all who look for Jesus <br> shall wear it by and by; <br> a crown of brightest glory, <br> which he will then bestow <br> on those who found his favour <br> and loved his name below. <br> <br>5 Theres a song for little children <br> above the bright blue sky, <br> a song that will not weary, <br> though sung continually; <br> a song which even angels <br> can never, never sing; <br> they know not Christ as Saviour, <br> but worship him as King. <br> <br>6 Theres a robe for little children <br> above the bright blue sky; <br> and a harp of sweetest music, <br> and palms of victory. <br> All, all above is treasured, <br> and found in Christ alone: <br> Lord, grant thy little children <br> to know thee as their own. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>670</p>
