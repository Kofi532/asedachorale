        <p><br>1 Come, sing with holy gladness, <br> high alleluias sing, <br> uplift your loud hosannas <br> to Jesus, Lord and King; <br> sing, boys, in joyful chorus <br> your hymn of praise today, <br> and sing, ye gentle maidens, <br> your sweet responsive lay. <br> <br>2 'Tis good for boys and maidens <br> sweet hymns to Christ to sing, <br> 'tis meet that children's voices <br> should praise the children's King; <br> for Jesus is salvation, <br> and glory, grace, and rest; <br> to babe, and boy, and maiden <br> the one Redeemer Blest. <br> <br>3 O boys, be strong in Jesus, <br> to toil for him is gain, <br> and Jesus wrought with Joseph <br> with chisel, saw, and plane; <br> O maidens, live for Jesus, <br> who was a maiden's Son; <br> be patient, pure, and gentle, <br> and perfect grace begun. <br> <br>4 Soon in the golden City <br> the boys and girls shall play, <br> and through the dazzling mansions <br> rejoice in endless day; <br> O Christ, prepare thy children <br> with that triumphant throng <br> to pass the burnished portals, <br> and sing the eternal song. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>644</p>
