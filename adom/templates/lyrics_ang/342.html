        <p><br>1 Gracious Savior, gentle Shepherd, <br> children all are dear to you; <br> may your loving arms enfold them <br> in your care their whole life through. <br> By your tending and protecting <br> keep them safe in all they do. <br> <br>2 Tender Shepherd, never leave them, <br> never let them go astray; <br> by your warning love directed, <br> may they walk the narrow way. <br> Thus direct them, thus defend them <br> lest they fall an easy prey. <br> <br>3 By your holy Word instruct them, <br> fill their minds with heav'nly light; <br> by your pow'rful grace convince them <br> always to approve what's right. <br> Let them feel your yoke is easy, <br> let them find your burden light. <br> <br>4 Taught to love the holy praises <br> which on earth your children sing, <br> with their lips and hearts, sincerely, <br> glad thank-off'rings may they bring, <br> then with all the saints in glory <br> join to praise their Lord and King. <br>  <br> Source: Christian Worship: Hymnal #<br>757</p>
