HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1 O Light, Whose beams illumine all <br> From twilight dawn to perfect day, <br> Shine Thou before the shadows fall <br> That lead our wandering feet astray; <br> At morn and eve Thy radiance pour, <br> That youth may love and age adore. <br> <br>2 O Way, through Whom our souls draw near <br> To yon eternal home of peace, <br> Where perfect love shall cast out fear, <br> And earth's vain toil and wandering cease; <br> In strength or weakness may we see <br> Our heavenward path, O Lord, through Thee. <br> <br>3 O Truth, before Whose shrine we bow, <br> Thou priceless Pearl for all who seek, <br> To Thee our earliest strength we vow, <br> Thy love will bless the pure and meek; <br> When dreams or mists beguile our sight, <br> Turn Thou our darkness into light. <br> <br>4 O Life, the well that ever flows <br> To slake the thirst of those that faint, <br> Thy power to bless, what seraph knows? <br> Thy joy supreme, what words can paint? <br> In earth's last hour of fleeting breath <br> Be Thou our conqueror over death. <br> <br>5 O Light, O Way, O Truth, O Life, <br> O Jesus, born mankind to save, <br> Give Thou Thy peace in deadliest strife; <br> Shed Thou Thy calm on stormiest wave; <br> Be Thou our hope, our joy, our dread, <br> Lord of the living and the dead. <br> The Hymnal: revised and enlarged as adopted by the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America in the year of our Lord <br>1892</p>
