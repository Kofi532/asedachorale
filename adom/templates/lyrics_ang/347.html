        <p><br>1 Come, Holy Ghost, Creator blest, <br> and make our hearts your place of rest; <br> come with your grace and heav'nly aid, <br> and fill the hearts which you have made. <br> <br>2 To you, the Counselor, we cry, <br> to you, the gift of God most high, <br> the fount of life, the fire of love, <br> the soul's anointing from above. <br> <br>3 In you, with graces sevenfold, <br> we God's almighty hand behold <br> while you with tongues of fire proclaim <br> to all the world his holy name. <br> <br>4 Your light to ev'ry thought impart, <br> and shed your love in ev'ry heart; <br> the weakness of our mortal state <br> with deathless might invigorate. <br> <br>5 Drive far away our wily foe, <br> and your abiding peace bestow; <br> with you as our protecting guide, <br> no evil can with us abide. <br> <br>6 Teach us to know the Father, Son, <br> and you, from both, as Three in One <br> that we your name may ever bless <br> and in our lives the truth confess. <br> <br>7 Praise we the Father and the Son <br> and Holy Spirit, with them One, <br> and may the Son on us bestow <br> the gifts that from the Spirit flow! <br>  <br> Source: Christian Worship: Hymnal #<br>586</p>
