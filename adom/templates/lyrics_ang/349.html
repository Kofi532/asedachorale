        <p><br>1 My God, accept my heart this day, <br> and make it always thine, <br> that I from thee no more may stray, <br> no more from thee decline. <br> <br>2 Before the cross of him who died, <br> behold, I prostrate fall; <br> let every sin be crucified, <br> and Christ be all in all. <br> <br>3 Anoint me with thy heavenly grace, <br> and seal me for thine own; <br> that I may see thy glorious face, <br> and worship near thy throne. <br> <br>4 Let every thought and work and word <br> to thee be ever given: <br> Then life shall be thy service, Lord, <br> and death the gate of heaven. <br> <br>5 All glory to the Father be, <br> all glory to the Son, <br> all glory, Holy Ghost, to thee, <br> while endless ages run. <br>  <br> Source: Ancient and Modern: hymns and songs for refreshing worship #<br>335</p>
