        <p><br>1 The voice that breathed oer Eden, <br> That earliest wedding day, <br> The primal marriage blessing, <br> It hath not passed away. <br> <br>2 Still in the pure espousal <br> Of Christian man and maid, <br> The holy Three are with us, <br> The threefold grace is said, <br> <br>3 For dower of blessed children, <br> For love and faith's sweet sake, <br> For high mysterious union <br> Which naught on earth may break. <br> <br>4 Be present, awful Father, <br> To give away this bride, <br> As Eve Thou gavst to Adam <br> Out of his own pierced side: <br> <br>5 Be present, Son of Mary, <br> To join their loving hands, <br> As Thou didst bind two natures <br> In Thine eternal hands! <br> <br>6 Be present, holiest Spirit, <br> To bless them as they kneel, <br> As Thou, for Christ the Bridegroom, <br> The heavenly Spouse dost seal! <br> <br>7 O spread Thy pure wing oer them, <br> Let no ill power find place, <br> When onward to Thine altar <br> Their hallowed path they trace. <br> <br>8 To cast their crowns before Thee <br> In perfect sacrifice, <br> Till to the home of gladness <br> With Christs own Bride they rise. <br> Amen. <br>  <br> Source: African Methodist Episcopal Church Hymnal #<br>548</p>
