        <p><br>1 O thou who makest souls to shine <br> with light from lighter worlds above, <br> and droppest glistening dew divine <br> on all who seek a SaviourÂ’s love; <br> <br>2 do thou thy benediction give <br> on all who teach, on all who learn, <br> that all thy church may holier live, <br> and every lamp more brightly burn. <br> <br>3 Give those who teach pure hearts and wise, <br> faith, hope, and love, all warmed by prayer; <br> themselves first training for the skies, <br> they best will raise their people there. <br> <br>4 Give those who learn the willing ear, <br> the spirit meek, the guileless mind; <br> such gifts will make the lowliest here <br> far better than a kingdom find. <br> <br>5 O bless the shepherd; bless the sheep: <br> that guide and guided both be one, <br> one in the faithful watch they keep, <br> until this hurrying life be done. <br> <br>6 If thus, good Lord, thy grace be given, <br> in thee to live, in thee to die, <br> before we upward pass to heaven, <br> we taste our immortality. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>702</p>
