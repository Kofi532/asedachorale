        <p><br>1 How blessed from the bonds of sin <br> And earthly fetters free, <br> In singleness of heart and aim <br> Thy servant, Lord, to be! <br> The hardest toil to undertake <br> With joy at thy command, <br> The meanest office to receive <br> With meekness at thy hand! <br> <br>2 With willing heart and longing eyes <br> To watch before thy gate, <br> Ready to run the weary race, <br> To bear the heavy weight; <br> No voice of thunder to expect, <br> But follow, calm and still, <br> For love can easily divine <br> The One BelovedÂ’s will. <br> <br>3 Thus may we serve thee, gracious Lord! <br> Thus ever thine alone, <br> Our souls and bodies given to thee, <br> The purchase thou hast won; <br> Through evil or through good report <br> Still keeping by thy side. <br> By life or death, in this poor flesh <br> Let Christ be magnified! <br> <br>4 How happily the working days <br> In this dear service fly! <br> How rapidly the closing hour, <br> The time of rest, draws nigh! <br> When all the faithful gather home, <br> A joyful company, <br> And ever where the Master is, <br> Shall his blest servants be. <br>  <br> Source: Service Book and Hymnal of the Lutheran Church in America #<br>60</p>
