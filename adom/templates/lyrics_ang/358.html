        <p><br>1 From Greenland's icy mountains, <br> From India's coral strand, <br> Where Afric's sunny fountains <br> Roll down their golden sand, <br> From many an ancient river, <br> From many a palmy plain, <br> They call us to deliver <br> Their land from error's chain. <br> <br>2 What though the spicy breezes <br> Blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle; <br> Though every prospect pleases, <br> And only man is vile? <br> In vain with lavish kindness <br> The gifts of God are strown; <br> The heathen in his blindness <br> Bows down to wood and stone. <br> <br>3 Shall we, whose souls are lighted <br> With wisdom from on high, <br> Shall we to men benighted <br> The lamp of life deny? <br> Salvation! O salvation! <br> The joyful sound proclaim, <br> Till earth's remotest nation <br> Has learned Messiah's name. <br> <br>4 Waft, waft, ye winds, His story, <br> And you, ye waters, roll, <br> Till, like a sea of glory, <br> It spreads from pole to pole: <br> Till o'er our ransomed nature <br> The Lamb for sinners slain, <br> Redeemer, King, Creator, <br> In bliss returns to reign. <br> Amen. <br>  <br> Source: Worship and Service Hymnal: For Church, School, and Home #<br>431</p>
