        <p><br>1 Through midnight gloom from Macedon <br> The cry of myriads as of one, <br> The voiceful silence of despair, <br> Is eloquent in awful prayer, <br> The souls exceeding bitter cry, <br> "Come oer and help us, or we die." <br> <br>2 How mournfully it echoes on! <br> For half the earth is Macedon; <br> These brethren to their brethren call, <br> And by the Love which loved them all, <br> And by the whole worlds Life they cry, <br> "O ye that live, behold we die!" <br> <br>3 By other sounds the world is won <br> Than that which wails from Macedon; <br> The roar of gain is round it rolled, <br> Or men unto themselves are sold, <br> And cannot list the alien cry, <br> "O hear and help us, lest we die." <br> <br>4 Yet with that cry from Macedon, <br> The very car of Christ rolls on; <br> "I come; who would abide My day <br> In yonder wilds prepare My way; <br> My voice is crying in their cry; <br> Help ye the dying, lest ye die." <br> <br>5 Jesus, for men of Man the Son, <br> Yea, Thine the cry from Macedon; <br> O by the kingdom and the power <br> And glory of Thine advent hour, <br> Wake heart and will to hear their cry; <br> Help us to help them, lest we die. <br>  <br> Source: The Lutheran Hymnary #<br>118</p>
