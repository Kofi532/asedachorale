        <p><br>1 Almighty God, Whose only Son <br> O'er sin and death the triumph won, <br> And ever lives to intercede <br> For souls who Thy sweet mercy need; <br> <br>2 In His dear Name to Thee we pray <br> For all who err and go astray, <br> For sinners, whereso'er they be, <br> Who do not serve and honor Thee. <br> <br>3 And some within thy sacred fold, <br> To holy tings are dead and cold, <br> And waste the precious hours of life <br> In selfish ease, or toil, or strife; <br> <br>4 And many a quickened soul within <br> There lurks the secret love of sin, <br> A wayward will, or anxious fears <br> Or lingering taint of bygone years; <br> <br>5 Oh, give repentance true and deep <br> To all Thy lost and wandering sheep! <br> And kindle in their hearts the fire <br> Of holy love and pure desire; <br> <br>6 That so from angel hosts above <br> May rise a sweeter song of love, <br> And we, with all the blest, adore <br> Thy Name, O God, for evermore. <br> Amen. <br>  <br> Source: The Hymnal, Revised and Enlarged, as adopted by the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America in the year of our Lord <br>1892 #<br>499</p>
