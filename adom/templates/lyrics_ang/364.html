        <p><br>1. God of grace, O let Thy light <br> Bless our dim and blinded sight; <br> Like the day-spring on the night, <br> Bid Thy grace to shine. <br> <br>2. To the nations led astray <br> Thine eternal love display: <br> Let Thy truth direct their way <br> Till the world be Thine. <br> <br>3. Praise to Thee, the faithful Lord; <br> Let all tongues in glad accord <br> Learn the good thanksgiving word, <br> Ever praising Thee. <br> <br>4. Let them moved to gladness sing, <br> Owning Thee their Judge and King; <br> Righteous truth shall bloom and spring <br> Where Thy rule shall be. <br> <br>5. Praise to Thee, all faithful Lord; <br> Let all tongues in glad accord <br> Speak the good thanksgiving word, <br> Heart rejoicing praise. <br> <br>6. So the fruitful earths increase, <br> Bounty of the God of peace, <br> Never in its course shall cease <br> Through the length of days; <br> <br>7. While His grace our life shall cheer, <br> Furthest lands shall own His fear, <br> Brought to Him in worship near, <br> Taught His mercys ways. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>1921</p>
