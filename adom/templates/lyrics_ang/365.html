        <p><br>1 O Lord of heav'n and earth and sea, <br> To thee all praise and glory be! <br> How shall we show our love to thee, <br> Who givest all? <br> We'll sing thy praise in songs of holy joy! <br> Thy work, O Lord, shall all our pow'rs employ! <br> Chorus: <br> Souls redeemed and sins forgiv'n, <br> For means of grace and hopes of heav'n, <br> Thou didst not spare thine only Son, <br> But freely gave that blessed One <br> To save us all. <br> <br>2 For peaceful hours and happy days, <br> For all the blessings earth displays, <br> We owe thee thankfulness and praise, <br> Who givest all! <br> We'll sing thy praise in songs of holy joy! <br> Thy work, O Lord, shall all our pow'rs employ! [Chorus] <br> <br>3 Whatever, Lord, we lend to thee, <br> Repaid a thousand fold shall be; <br> Then gladly will we give to thee, <br> Who givest all! <br> We'll sing thy praise in songs of holy joy! <br> Thy work, O Lord, shall all our pow'rs employ! [Chorus] <br> <br>4 To thee from whom we all derive, <br> Our life, our gifts, our pow'r to give; <br> O may we ever with thee live, <br> Who givest all! <br> We'll sing thy praise in songs of holy joy! <br> Thy work, O Lord, shall all our pow'rs employ! [Chorus]</p>
