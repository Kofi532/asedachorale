        <p><br>1 Lord of glory, you have bought us <br> with your life-blood as the price, <br> never grudging for the lost ones <br> that tremendous sacrifice; <br> and with that have freely given <br> blessings countless as the sand <br> to th'unthankful and the evil <br> with your own unsparing hand. <br> <br>2 Grant us hearts, dear Lord, to give you <br> gladly, freely, of your own. <br> With the sunshine of your goodness <br> melt our thankless hearts of stone <br> till our cold and selfish natures, <br> warmed by you, at length believe <br> that more happy and more blessed <br> 'tis to give than to receive. <br> <br>3 Wondrous honor you have given <br> to our humblest charity <br> in your own mysterious sentence, <br> "You have done it all for me." <br> Can it be, O gracious Master, <br> that you need what we can do, <br> saying by your poor and needy, <br> "Give as I have giv'n to you"? <br> <br>4 Lord of glory, you have bought us <br> with your life-blood as the price, <br> never grudging for the lost ones <br> that tremendous sacrifice. <br> Give us faith to trust you boldly, <br> hope, to stay our souls on you; <br> but, oh, best of all your graces, <br> with your love our love renew. <br>  <br> Source: Christian Worship: Hymnal #<br>767</p>
