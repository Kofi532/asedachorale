        <p><br>1 To thee, O Lord, our hearts we raise <br> in hymns of adoration, <br> to thee bring sacrifice of praise <br> with shouts of exultation: <br> bright robes of gold the fields adorn, <br> the hills with joy are ringing, <br> the valleys stand so thick with corn <br> that even they are singing.<br>2 And now, on this our festal day, <br> thy bounteous hand confessing, <br> upon thine altar, Lord, we lay <br> the first-fruits of thy blessing: <br> by thee the hungry soul is fed <br> with gifts of grace supernal; <br> thou who dost give us earthly bread, <br> give us the bread eternal.<br>3 We bear the burden of the day, <br> and often toil seems dreary; <br> but labour ends with sunset ray, <br> and rest comes for the weary: <br> may we, the angel-reaping o'er, <br> stand at the last accepted, <br> Christ's golden sheaves for evermore <br> to garners bright elected.<br>4 O blessèd is that land of God, <br> where saints abide for ever; <br> where golden fields spread far and broad, <br> where flows the crystal river: <br> the strains of all its holy throng <br> with ours today are blending; <br> thrice blessèd is that harvest-song <br> which never hath an ending. <br>  <br> Source: Ancient and Modern: hymns and songs for refreshing worship #<br>289</p>
