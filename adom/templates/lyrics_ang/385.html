        <p><br>1. God the Father! Whose creation <br> Gives to flowers and fruits their birth, <br> Thou, whose yearly operation <br> Brings the hour of harvest mirth, <br> Here to Thee we make oblation <br> Of the August-gold of earth. <br> <br>2. God the Word! the sun, maturing <br> With his blessèd ray the corn, <br> Spake of Thee, O Sun enduring, <br> Thee, O everlasting Morn! <br> Thee in whom our woes find curing <br> Thee that liftest up our horn. <br> <br>3. God the Holy Ghost! the showers <br> That have fattened out the grain, <br> Types of Thy celestial powers, <br> Symbols of baptismal rain, <br> Shadowed out the grace that dowers <br> All the faithful of Thy train. <br> <br>4. When the harvest of each nation <br> Severs righteousness from sin, <br> And archangel proclamation <br> Bids to put the sickle in, <br> And each age and generation <br> Sink to woe, or glory win; <br> <br>5. Grant that we, or young, or hoary, <br> Lengthened be our span or brief, <br> Whatsoeer the life long story <br> Of our joy or of our grief, <br> May be garnered up in glory <br> As Thine own elected sheaf. <br> <br>6. Laud to Him to whom supernal <br> Thrones and virtues bend the knee; <br> Laud to Him from whom infernal <br> Powers and dominations flee; <br> Laud to Him the co-eternal <br> Paraclete, forever be. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>1748</p>
