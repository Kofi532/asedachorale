        <p><br>1 The Sower went forth sowing, <br> the seed in secret slept <br> through weeks of faith and patience, <br> till out the green blade crept; <br> and warmed by golden sunshine, <br> and fed by silver rain, <br> at last the fields were whitened <br> to harvest once again. <br> O praise the heavenly Sower, <br> who gave the fruitful seed, <br> and watched and watered duly, <br> and ripened for our need. <br> <br>2 Behold! the heavenly Sower <br> goes forth with better seed, <br> the word of sure salvation, <br> with feet and hands that bleed; <br> here in his church tis scattered, <br> our spirits are the soil; <br> then let an ample fruitage <br> repay his pain and toil. <br> Oh, beauteous is the harvest <br> wherein all goodness thrives, <br> and this the true thanksgiving, <br> the first-fruits of our lives. <br> <br>3 Within a hallowed acre <br> he sows yet other grain, <br> when peaceful earth receiveth <br> the dead he died to gain; <br> for though the growth be hidden, <br> we know that they shall rise; <br> yea even now they ripen <br> in sunny paradise. <br> O summer land of harvest, <br> O fields for ever white <br> with souls that wear Christs raiment, <br> with crowns of golden light! <br> <br>4 One day the heavenly Sower <br> shall reap where he hath sown, <br> and come again rejoicing, <br> and with him bring his own; <br> and then the fan of judgement <br> shall winnow from his floor <br> the chaff into the furnace <br> that flameth evermore. <br> O holy, awful Reaper, <br> have mercy in the day, <br> thou puttest in thy sickle, <br> and cast us not away. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>722</p>
