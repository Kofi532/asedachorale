        <p><br>1 What our Father does is well: <br> Blessed truth His children tell! <br> Tho' He send, for plenty, want, <br> Tho' the harvest store be scant, <br> Yet we rest upon His love, <br> Seeking better things above. <br> <br>2 What our Father does is well. <br> Shall the wilful heart rebel <br> If a blessing He withhold <br> In the field or in the fold? <br> Is He not Himself to be <br> All our store eternally? <br> <br>3 What our Father does is well. <br> Tho' He sadden hill and dell, <br> Upward yet our praises rise <br> For the strength His Word supplies. <br> He has called us sons of God; <br> Can we murmur at His rod? <br> <br>4 What our Father does is well; <br> May the tho't within us dwell! <br> Tho' nor milk nor honey flow <br> In our barren Canaan now, <br> God can save us in our need, <br> God can bless us, God can feed. <br> <br>5 Therefore unto Him we raise <br> Hymns of glory, songs of praise. <br> To the Father and the Son <br> And the Spirit, Three in One, <br> Honor, might, and glory be <br> Now and through eternity. <br> Amen. <br>  <br> Source: The Lutheran Hymnal #<br>571</p>
