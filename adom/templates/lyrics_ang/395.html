HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1. O Word of God above, <br> Who fillest all in all, <br> Hallow this house with Thy sure love, <br> And bless our festival. <br> <br>2. Here from the font is poured <br> Grace on each sinful child; <br> The blest anointing of the Lord <br> Brightens the once defiled. <br> <br>3. Here Christ to faithful hearts <br> His body gives for food; <br> The Lamb of God Himself imparts <br> The chalice of His blood. <br> <br>4. Here guilty souls that pine <br> May health and pardon win; <br> The Judge acquits, and grace divine <br> Restores the dead in sin. <br> <br>5. Yea, God enthroned on high <br> Here also dwells to bless; <br> Here trains adoring souls that sigh <br> His mansions to possess. <br> <br>6. Against this holy home <br> Rude tempests harmless beat, <br> And SatanÂ’s angels fiercely come <br> But to endure defeat. <br> <br>7. All might, all praise be Thine, <br> Father, co-equal Son, <br> And Spirit, Bond of love divine, <br> Where endless ages run. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>5522</p>
