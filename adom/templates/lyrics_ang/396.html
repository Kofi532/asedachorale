        <p><br>1 Bless√®d city, heavenly Salem, <br> vision dear of peace and love, <br> who of living stones art builded <br> in the height of heaven above, <br> and with angel hosts encircled, <br> as a bride dost earthward move! <br> <br>2 From celestial realms descending, <br> bridal glory round thee shed, <br> meet for him whose love espoused thee, <br> to thy Lord shalt thou be led; <br> all thy streets and all thy bulwarks <br> of pure gold are fashioned. <br> <br>3 Bright thy gates of pearl are shining, <br> they are open evermore; <br> and by virtue of his merits <br> thither faithful souls do soar, <br> who for Christ's dear name in this world <br> pain and tribulation bore. <br> <br>4 Many a blow and biting sculpture <br> polished well those stones elect, <br> in their places now compacted <br> by the heavenly Architect, <br> who therewith hath willed for ever <br> that his palace should be decked. <br> <br>5 Christ is made the sure foundation, <br> Christ the Head and cornerstone, <br> chosen of the Lord, and precious, <br> binding all the church in one, <br> Holy Sion's help for ever, <br> and her confidence alone. <br> <br>6 All that dedicated city, <br> dearly loved of God on high, <br> in exultant jubilation <br> pours perpetual melody, <br> God the One in Three adoring <br> in glad hymns eternally. <br> <br>7 To this temple, where we call thee, <br> come, O Lord of Hosts, to-day; <br> with thy wonted loving-kindness <br> hear thy servants as they pray, <br> and thy fullest benediction <br> shed within its walls alway. <br> <br>8 Here vouchsafe to all thy servants <br> what they ask of thee to gain, <br> what they gain from thee for ever <br> with the blessed to retain, <br> and hereafter in thy glory <br> evermore with thee to reign. <br> Doxology: <br> Laud and honour to the Father, <br> laud and honour to the Son, <br> laud and honour to the Spirit, <br> ever Three, and ever One, <br> consubstantial, co-eternal, <br> while unending ages run. <br>  <br> Source: Ancient and Modern: hymns and songs for refreshing worship #<br>291</p>
