        <p><br>1 Lift the strain of high thanksgiving! <br> Tread with songs the hallowed way! <br> Praise our father's God, for mercies <br> New to us their sons to-day; <br> Here they built for Him a dwelling, <br> Served Him here in ages past, <br> Fixed it for His sure possession, <br> Holy ground, while time shall last. <br> <br>2 When the years had wrought their changes, <br> He, our own unchanging God, <br> Thought on this His habitation, <br> Looked on His decayed abode; <br> Heard our prayers, and helped our counsels, <br> Blessed the silver and the gold, <br> Till once more His house is standing, <br> Firm and stately as of old. <br> <br>3 Entering then Thy gates with praises, <br> Lord, be ours Thine Israel's prayer: <br> "Rise into Thy place of resting, <br> Show Thy promised presence there!" <br> Let the gracious word be spoken <br> Here, as once on Sion's height, <br> "This shall be my rest forever, <br> This My dwelling of delight." <br> <br>4 Fill this latter house with glory <br> Greater than the former knew; <br> Clothe with righteousness Thy priesthood, <br> Guide us all to reverence true; <br> Let Thy Holy One's anointing <br> Here its sevenfold blessing shed; <br> Spread for us the heavenly banquet, <br> Satisfy Thy poor with bread. <br> <br>5 Praise to Thee, almighty Father, <br> Praise to Thee, eternal Son, <br> Praise to Thee, all-quickening Spirit, <br> Ever bless√®d Three in One: <br> Threefold Power and Grace and Wisdom, <br> Molding out of sinful clay, <br> Living stones for that true temple, <br> Which shall never know decay. <br> Amen. <br> The Hymnal: revised and enlarged as adopted by the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America in the year of our Lord <br>1892</p>
