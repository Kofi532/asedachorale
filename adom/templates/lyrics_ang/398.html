        <p><br>1 Day of wrath, O day of mourning! <br> See fulfilled the prophet's warning: <br> Heav'n and earth in ashes burning. <br> Wondrous sound the trumpet flingeth, <br> Through earth's sepulchers it ringeth, <br> All before the throne it bringeth. <br> O what fear man's bosom rendeth <br> When from heav'n the Judge descendeth <br> On whose sentence all dependeth. <br> <br>2 Death is struck and nature quaking; <br> All creation is awaking, <br> To its Judge an answer making. <br> Lo, the book, exactly worded, <br> Wherein all hath been recorded; <br> Thence shall judgment be awarded. <br> When the Judge His seat attaineth, <br> And each hidden deed arraigneth, <br> Nothing unavenged remaineth. <br> <br>3 What shall I, frail man, be pleading, <br> Who for me be interceding <br> When the just are mercy needing? <br> King of Majesty tremendous, <br> Who dost free salvation send us, <br> Fount of pity, then befriend us! <br> Righteous Judge, for sin's pollution <br> Grant Thy gift of absolution <br> Ere the Day of Retribution. <br> <br>4 Faint and weary Thou hast sought me, <br> On the cross of suff'ring bought me; <br> Shall such grace be vainly brought me? <br> Think, good Jesus, my salvation <br> Caused Thy wondrous incarnation; <br> Leave me not to sin's damnation! <br> Guilty now I pour my moaning, <br> All my shame with anguish owning: <br> Hear, O Christ, Thy servant's groaning! <br> <br>5 Bows my heart in meek submission, <br> Strewn with ashes of contrition; <br> Help me in my last condition! <br> Worthless are my prayers and sighing; <br> Yet, Good Lord, in grace complying, <br> Rescue me from fires undying. <br> Thou the sinful woman savedst; <br> Thou the dying thief forgavest; <br> Thus to me true hope vouchsafest! <br> <br>6 With Thy favored sheep then place me, <br> Nor among the goats abase me, <br> But to Thy right hand upraise me. <br> While the wicked are confounded, <br> Doomed to flames of woe unbounded, <br> Call me, with Thy saints surrounded. <br> To the rest Thou didst prepare me <br> On Thy cross; O Christ, upbear me! <br> Spare, O God, in mercy spare me. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Evangelical Lutheran Hymnary #<br>537</p>
