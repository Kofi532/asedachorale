HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1. Thou spakest, Lord, and into one <br> The floods together flowed; <br> Freed from its watery veil, the land <br> Its verdant pastures showed. <br> <br>2. O Father, who the earth has given <br> Our place of toil to be, <br> Knit all within its one wide bound <br> In one true charity. <br> <br>3. Strangers and pilgrims here below, <br> We seek a home above, <br> Where Thou wilt gather in Thine own <br> Who live in holy love. <br> <br>4. Unloving words, with deeds of ill <br> And words of angry strife, <br> Shall never, Lord, Thy glory see, <br> Nor win the heavenly life. <br> <br>5. The earth itself from day to day <br> Their burden scarce sustains, <br> And yearns, in travail, to be free <br> From dark corruptions chains. <br> <br>6. Yea, we too groan within ourselves, <br> And that adoption wait <br> For which the Holy Spirits seal <br> Did us predestinate. <br> <br>7. Eternal glory be ascribed <br> To God, the One in Three, <br> By whom is poured into our hearts <br> The grace of charity. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>6933</p>
