        <p><br>1 Now the laborer's task is o'er; <br> Now the battle day is past; <br> Now upon the farther shore <br> Lands the voyager at last. <br> Refrain: <br> Father, in thy gracious keeping, <br> Leave we now thy servant sleeping. A-men. <br> <br>2 There the tears of earth are dried, <br> There its hidden things are clear, <br> There the work of life is tried <br> By a juster judge than here. [Refrain] <br> <br>3 There the penitents, that turn <br> To the cross their dying eyes, <br> All the love of Jesus learn <br> At his feet in Paradise. [Refrain] <br> <br>4 'Earth to earth, and dust to dust,' <br> Calmly now the words we say; <br> Leaving him to sleep, in trust, <br> Till the resurrection-day. [Refrain] <br> (At sea, instead of stanza <br>4, the following shall be sung:) <br> <br>5 'Till the sea gives up its dead,' <br> Calmly now the words we say, <br> Laid in ocean's quiet bed <br> Till the resurrection-day: [Refrain] <br> Amen. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Service Book and Hymnal of the Lutheran Church in America #<br>296</p>
