        <p><br>1. The Shepherd now was smitten; <br> The wolf was ravening near; <br> The scattered flock he threatened, <br> But knew not whose they were. <br> <br>2. In zealous fury seeking <br> To bind and crucify, <br> A sudden voice withheld him, <br> A loud and startling cry: <br> <br>3. Saul! Saul! why blindly daring <br> To persecute thy Lord? <br> Tis Jesus whom thou hatest, <br> Rebel not at My Word. <br> <br>4. Then forth in prayer he stretcheth <br> Those hands prepared to slay; <br> What wouldst Thou with Thy servant? <br> My Lord and Master, say. <br> <br>5. Christs foe becomes His soldier, <br> The wolf destroys no more, <br> A gentle lamb he enters <br> The sheepfold by the door. <br> <br>6. O voice of God Almighty, <br> What wonders hath it wrought! <br> It rends the lofty cedars, <br> It bends the haughty thought. <br> <br>7. Jesu, our Shepherd, cease not <br> Thy flock from harm to free, <br> And, when Thy sheep are wandering, <br> O lead them back to Thee. <br> <br>8. To Father, Son, and Spirit, <br> All glory, praise and might, <br> Who called us out of darkness <br> To His own glorious light. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>6168</p>
