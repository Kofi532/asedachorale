        <p><br>1 We sing the glorious conquest <br> before Damascus gate, <br> when Saul, the church's spoiler, <br> came breathing threats and hate; <br> the ravening wolf rushed forward <br> full early to the prey; <br> but lo, the Shepherd met him, <br> and bound him fast today. <br> <br>2 O glory most excelling <br> that smote across his path! <br> O light that pierced and blinded <br> the zealot in his wrath, <br> O voice that spake within him <br> the calm reproving word, <br> O love that sought and held him <br> the bondman of his Lord! <br> <br>3 O wisdom, ordering all things <br> in order strong and sweet, <br> what nobler spoil was ever <br> cast at the Victor's feet? <br> What wiser master-builder <br> e'er wrought at thine employ <br> than he, till now so furious <br> your building to destroy? <br> <br>4 Lord, teach thy church the lesson, <br> still in her darkest hour <br> of weakness and of danger <br> to trust thy hidden power: <br> thy grace by ways mysterious <br> the wrath of man can bind, <br> and in thy boldest foeman <br> thy chosen saint can find. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>761</p>
