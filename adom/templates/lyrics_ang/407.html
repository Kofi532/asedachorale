        <p><br>1 O Zion, open wide thy gates, <br> let symbols disappear; <br> a priest and victim, both in one, <br> the Truth himself, is here. <br> <br>2 Aware of hidden deity, <br> the lowly Virgin brings <br> her newborn babe, with two young doves, <br> her humble offerings. <br> <br>3 The ag√®d Simeon sees at last <br> his Lord, so long desired, <br> and Anna welcomes Israel's hope, <br> with holy rapture fired. <br> <br>4 But silent knelt the mother blest <br> of the yet silent Word, <br> and pondering all things in her heart, <br> with speechless praise adored. <br> <br>5 All glory to the Father be, <br> all glory to the Son, <br> all glory, Holy Ghost, to thee, <br> while endless ages run. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>771a</p>
