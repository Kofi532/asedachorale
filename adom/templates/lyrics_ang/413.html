HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1 O Son of God, our Captain of salvation, <br> Thyself by suffering schooled to human grief, <br> We bless Thee for Thy sons of consolation, <br> Who follow in the steps of Thee their Chief; <br> <br>2 Those whom Thy Spirit's dread vocation severs, <br> To lead the vanguard of Thy conquering host; <br> Whose toilsome years are spent in brave endeavors <br> To bear Thy saving Name from coast to coast; <br> <br>3 Those whose bright faith makes feeble hearts grow stronger, <br> And sends fresh warriors to the great campaign, <br> Bids the lone convert feel estranged no longer, <br> And wins the sundered to be one again; <br> <br>4 And all true helpers, patient, kind, and skilful, <br> Who shed Thy light across our darkened earth, <br> Counsel the doubting, and restrain the wilful, <br> Soothe the sick bed, and share the children's mirth. <br> <br>5 Such was Thy Levite, strong in self-oblation <br> To cast his all at Thine Apostles' feet; <br> He whose new name, through every Christian nation <br> From age to age our thankful strains repeat. <br> <br>6 Thus, Lord, Thy Barnabas in memory keeping, <br> Still be Thy Church's watchword, "Comfort ye;" <br> Till in our Father's house shall end our weeping, <br> And all our wants be satisfied in Thee. <br> Amen. <br> The Hymnal: revised and enlarged as adopted by the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America in the year of our Lord <br>1892</p>
