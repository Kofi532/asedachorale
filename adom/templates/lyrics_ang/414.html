        <p><br>1 Lo, from the desert homes, <br> where he hath hid so long, <br> the new Elijah comes, <br> in sternest wisdom strong; <br> the voice that cries <br> of Christ from high, <br> and judgement nigh <br> from opening skies. <br> <br>2 Your God een now doth stand <br> at heavens opening door; <br> his fan is in his hand, <br> and he will purge his floor; <br> the wheat he claims <br> and with him stows, <br> the chaff He throws <br> to quenchless flames. <br> <br>3 Ye haughty mountains, bow <br> your sky-aspiring heads; <br> ye valleys, hiding low, <br> lift up your gentle meads; <br> make his way plain <br> your king before, <br> for evermore <br> he comes to reign. <br> <br>4 May thy dread voice around, <br> thou harbinger of Light, <br> on our dull ears still sound, <br> lest here we sleep in night, <br> till judgement come, <br> and on our path <br> the Lamb's dread wrath <br> shall burst in doom. <br> <br>5 O God, with loves sweet might, <br> who dost anoint and arm <br> Christs soldier for the fight <br> with grace that shields from harm <br> thrice blessèd Three, <br> heavens endless days <br> shall sing thy praise <br> eternally. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>775</p>
