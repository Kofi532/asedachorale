        <p><br>1 Forsaken once, and thrice denied, <br> the risen Lord gave pardon free, <br> stood once again at Peters side, <br> and asked him, 'Lovest thou me?' <br> <br>2 How many times with faithless word <br> have we denied his holy name, <br> how oft forsaken our dear Lord, <br> and shrunk when trial came! <br> <br>3 Saint Peter, when the cock crew clear, <br> went out, and wept his broken faith; <br> strong as a rock through strife and fear, <br> he served his Lord till death. <br> <br>4 How oft his cowardice of heart <br> we have without his love sincere, <br> the sin without the sorrows smart, <br> the shame without the tear! <br> <br>5 O oft forsaken, oft denied, <br> forgive our shame, wash out our sin; <br> look on us from thy Fathers side <br> and let that sweet look win. <br> <br>6 Hear when we call thee from the deep, <br> still walk beside us on the shore, <br> give hands to work, and eyes to weep, <br> and hearts to love thee more. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>783</p>
