HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1 "Thou art the Christ, O Lord, <br> The Son of God, most high!" <br> Forever be adored, <br> That Name in earth and sky. <br> In which, tho' mortal strength may fail, <br> The saints of God at last prevail! <br> <br>2 Oh, surely he was blest, <br> With blessedness unpriced, <br> Who taught of God, confessed <br> The Godhead in the Christ! <br> For of Thy Church, Lord, Thou didst own <br> Thy saint a true foundation-stone. <br> <br>3 Thrice fallen, thrice restored! <br> The bitter lesson learnt, <br> That heart for Thee, O Lord, <br> With triple ardor burnt. <br> The cross he took he laid not down <br> Until he grasped the martyr's crown. <br> <br>4 Oh bright triumphant faith! <br> Oh courage void of fears! <br> Oh love, most strong in death! <br> Oh penitential tears! <br> By these, Lord, keep us lest we fall, <br> And make us go where Thou shalt call. <br> Amen. <br> The Hymnal: revised and enlarged as adopted by the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America in the year of our Lord <br>1892</p>
