HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1 King of saints, to Whom the number <br> Of Thy starry host is known, <br> Many a name, by man forgotten, <br> Lives for ever round Thy throne: <br> Lights, which earth-born mists have darkened, <br> There are shining full and clear, <br> Princes in the court of heaven, <br> Nameless, unremembered here. <br> <br>2 In the roll of Thine apostles <br> One there stands, Bartholomew, <br> He for whom to-day we offer, <br> Year by year, our praises due: <br> How he toiled for Thee and suffered <br> None on earth can now record; <br> All his saintly life is hidden <br> In the knowledge of his Lord; <br> <br>3 None can tell us: all is written <br> In the Lamb's great book of life, <br> All the faith, and prayer, and patience <br> All the toiling, and the strife: <br> There are told Thy hidden treasures: <br> Number us, O Lord, with them, <br> When Thou makest up the jewels <br> Of Thy living diadem. <br> Amen. <br> The Hymnal: revised and enlarged as adopted by the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America in the year of our Lord <br>1892</p>
