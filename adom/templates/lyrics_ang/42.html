HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1. The fish in wave, the bird on wing, <br> God bade the waters bear; <br> Each for our mortal bodys food <br> His gracious hands prepare. <br> <br>2. But other food, of richer cost, <br> The immortal spirit needs; <br> By faith it lives on every word <br> That from His mouth proceeds. <br> <br>3. Faith springing from the blood of Christ, <br> Has flowed oer every land; <br> And sinners through the vanquished world <br> Bow down to its command. <br> <br>4. Its light the joy of Heavn reveals <br> To hearts made pure within; <br> And bids them seek by worthy deeds <br> Eternal crowns to win. <br> <br>5. By faith the saints of old were strong <br> The lions wrath to tame; <br> By faith they spurned the tyrants threats, <br> And scorned the raging flame. <br> <br>6. Lord, grant that we the path may tread <br> Whereon its light doth shine; <br> And gather, as we onward go, <br> The fruits of love divine. <br> <br>7. O praise the Father; praise the Son, <br> On whose most precious blood <br> Rests all our faith; and praise to Him <br> Who with Them both is God. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>1532</p>
