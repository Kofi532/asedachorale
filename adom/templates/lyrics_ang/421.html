        <p><br>1 Praise to God who reigns above <br> binding earth and heaven in love; <br> all the armies of the sky <br> worship his dread sovereignty. <br> <br>2 Seraphim his praises sing, <br> cherubim on fourfold wing, <br> thrones, dominions, princes, powers, <br> marshalled might that never cowers. <br> <br>3 Speeds the archangel from his face, <br> bearing messages of grace; <br> angel hosts his words fulfil, <br> ruling nature by his will. <br> <br>4 Yet on man thy joy to wait, <br> all that bright celestial state, <br> for in Man their Lord they see, <br> Christ, the incarnate deity. <br> <br>5 On the throne their Lord who died <br> sits in Manhood glorified; <br> where his people faint below <br> angels count it joy to go. <br> <br>6 O the depths of joy divine, <br> thrilling through those orders nine, <br> when the lost are found again, <br> when the banished come to reign! <br> <br>7 Now in faith, in hope, in love, <br> we will join the choirs above, <br> praising, with the heavenly host, <br> Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>797</p>
