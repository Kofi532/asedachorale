        <p><br>1. Christ, in highest Heavn enthronèd, <br> Equal of the Fathers might, <br> By pure spirits, trembling, ownèd, <br> God of God, and Light of Light, <br> Thee mid angel hosts we sing, <br> Thee their Maker and their King. <br> <br>2. All who circling round adore Thee, <br> All who bow before Thy throne, <br> Burn with flaming zeal before Thee, <br> Thy behests to carry down; <br> To and fro, twixt earth and Heavn, <br> Speed they each on errands given. <br> <br>3. First of all those legions glorious, <br> Michael waves his sword of flame, <br> Who of old in war victorious <br> Did the Dragons fierceness tame; <br> Who with might invincible <br> Thrust the rebel down to hell. <br> <br>4. Strong to aid the sick and dying, <br> Called from Heavn they swiftly fly, <br> Grace divine and strength supplying <br> In their mortal agony: <br> Souls released from bondage here <br> Safe to Paradise they bear. <br> <br>5. To the Father praise be given <br> By the unfallen angel host, <br> Who in His great war have striven <br> With the legions of the lost; <br> Equal praise in highest Heavn <br> To the Son and Holy Ghost. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>804</p>
