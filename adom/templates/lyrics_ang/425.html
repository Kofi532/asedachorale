HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1 What thanks and praise to Thee we owe, <br> O Priest and Sacrifice divine, <br> For Thy dear saint thro' whom we know <br> So many a gracious word of Thine; <br> <br>2 Whom Thou didst choose to tell the tale <br> Of all Thy manhood's toils and tears, <br> And for a moment lift the veil <br> That hides Thy boyhood's spotless years. <br> <br>3 And still the Church through all her days <br> Uplifts the strains that never cease, <br> The bless√®d Virgin's hymn of praise, <br> The aged Simeon's words of peace. <br> <br>4 O happy saint! whose sacred page, <br> So rich in words of truth and love, <br> Pours on the Church from age to age <br> This healing unction from above; <br> <br>5 The witness of the Saviour's life, <br> The great apostle's chosen friend <br> Through weary years of toil and strife, <br> And still found faithful to the end. <br> <br>6 So grant us, Lord, like him to live, <br> Beloved by man, approved by Thee, <br> Till Thou at last the summons give, <br> And we, with him, Thy face shall see. <br> Amen. <br> The Hymnal: revised and enlarged as adopted by the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America in the year of our Lord <br>1892</p>
