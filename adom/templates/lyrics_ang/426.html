HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1 Thou Who sentest Thine apostles <br> Two by two before Thy face, <br> Partners in the night of toiling, <br> Heirs together of Thy grace, <br> Throned at length, their labors ended, <br> Each in his appointed place; <br> <br>2 Praise to Thee for those Thy champions <br> Whom our hymns to-day proclaim; <br> One, whose zeal by Thee enlightened <br> Burned anew with nobler flame; <br> One, the kinsman of Thy childhood, <br> Brought at last to know Thy Name. <br> <br>3 Praise to Thee! Thy fire within them <br> Spake in love, and wrought in power; <br> Seen in mighty stars and wonders <br> In Thy Church's mourning hour; <br> Heard in tones of sternest warning <br> When the storms began to lower. <br> <br>4 Once again those storms are breaking; <br> Hearts are failing, love grows cold; <br> Faith is darkened, sin abounding; <br> Grievous wolves assail Thy fold: <br> Save us, Lord, our one Salvation; <br> Save the faith revealed of old. <br> <br>5 Call the erring by Thy pity; <br> Warn the tempted by Thy fear; <br> Keep us true to Thine allegiance, <br> Counting life itself less dear; <br> Standing firmer, holding faster, <br> As we see the end draw near: <br> <br>6 Till with holy Jude and Simon <br> And the thousand faithful more, <br> We, the good confession witnessed <br> And the lifelong conflict o'er, <br> On the sea of fire and crystal <br> Stand, and wonder, and adore. <br> Amen. <br> The Hymnal: revised and enlarged as adopted by the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America in the year of our Lord <br>1892</p>
