        <p><br>1 Who are these like stars appearing, <br> these before God's throne who stand? <br> Each a golden crown is wearing; <br> who are all this glorious band? <br> Alleluia! Hark, they sing, <br> praising loud their heav'nly King. <br> <br>2 Who are these of dazzling brightness, <br> these in God's own truth arrayed, <br> clad in robes of purest whiteness, <br> robes whose lustre ne'er shall fade, <br> ne'er be touched by time's rude hand? <br> Whence come all this glorious band? <br> <br>3 These are they who have contended <br> for their Savior's honor long, <br> wrestling on 'til life was ended, <br> foll'wing not the sinful throng; <br> these, who well the fight sustained, <br> triumph thro' the Lamb have gained. <br> <br>4 These are they whose hearts were riven, <br> sore with woe and anguish tried, <br> who in pray'r full oft have striven <br> with the God they glorified; <br> now, their painful conflict o'er, <br> God has bid them weep no more. <br> <br>5 These, like priests, have watched and waited, <br> off'ring up to Christ their will; <br> soul and body consecrated, <br> day and night to serve him still: <br> now in God's most holy place <br> blest they stand before his face. <br>  <br> Source: Trinity Psalter Hymnal #<br>469</p>
