        <p><br>1 The saints of God! their conflict past, <br> And life's long battle won at last, <br> No more they need the shield or sword, <br> They cast them down before the Lord: <br> O happy saints, for ever blest, <br> At Jesus' feet how safe your rest! <br> <br>2 The saints of God! their wanderings done, <br> No more their weary course they run, <br> No more they faint, no more they fall, <br> No foes oppress, no fears appall: <br> O happy saints, for ever blest, <br> In that dear home how sweet your rest! <br> <br>3 The saints of God! life's voyage o'er, <br> Safe landed on that blissful shore, <br> No stormy tempests now they dread, <br> No roaring billows lift their head: <br> O happy saints, for ever blest, <br> In that calm haven of your rest! A-men. <br> <br>4 The saints of God their vigil keep, <br> While yet their mortal bodies sleep, <br> Till from the dust they too shall rise <br> And soar triumphant to the skies: <br> O happy saints, rejoice and sing; <br> He quickly comes, your Lord and King! <br> <br>5 O God of saints! to thee we cry; <br> O Saviour! plead for us on high; <br> O Holy Ghost! our guide and friend, <br> Grant us thy grace till life shall end; <br> That with all saints our rest may be <br> In that bright Paradise with thee! <br> Amen. <br>  <br> Source: Service Book and Hymnal of the Lutheran Church in America #<br>145</p>
