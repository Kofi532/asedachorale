        <p><br>1 Christians, come, in sweetest measures <br> Sing of those who spread the treasures <br> In the holy Gospels shrined; <br> Blessèd tidings of salvation, <br> Peace on earth their proclamation, <br> Love from God to lost mankind. <br> <br>2 See the rivers four that gladden <br> With their streams the better Eden, <br> Planted by our Savior dear. <br> Christ the Fountain, these the waters, <br> Drink, O Zions sons and daughters; <br> Drink and find salvation here. <br> <br>3 Here our souls, by Jesus sated, <br> More and more shall be translated <br> Earths temptations far above; <br> Freed from sins abhorred dominion, <br> Soaring on angelic pinion, <br> They shall reach the Source of love. <br> <br>4 Then shall thanks and praise ascending <br> For Thy mercies without ending <br> Rise to Thee, O Savior blest. <br> With Thy gracious aid defend us, <br> Let Thy guiding light attend us, <br> Bring us to Thy place of rest. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Evangelical Lutheran Hymnary #<br>411</p>
