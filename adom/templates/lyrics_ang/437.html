        <p><br>1 For all the saints who from their labors rest, <br> who Thee by faith before the world confessed; <br> Thy name, O Jesus, be forever blest. <br> Alleluia, Alleluia! <br> <br>2 Thou wast their Rock, their Fortress and their Might; <br> Thou, Lord, their Captain in the well-fought fight; <br> Thou, in the darkness drear, their one true Light. <br> Alleluia, Alleluia! <br> <br>3 O blest communion, fellowship divine! <br> We feebly struggle, they in glory shine; <br> yet all are one in Thee, for all are Thine. <br> Alleluia, Alleluia! <br> <br>4 And when the strife is fierce, the warfare long, <br> steals on the ear the distant triumph song, <br> and hearts are brave again, and arms are strong. <br> Alleluia, Alleluia! <br> <br>5 But then there breaks a still more glorious day: <br> the saints triumphant rise in bright array; <br> the King of glory passes on His way. <br> Alleluia, Alleluia! <br> <br>6 From earth's wide bounds, from ocean's farthest coast, <br> through gates of pearl streams in the countless host, <br> in praise of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. <br> Alleluia, Alleluia! <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God #<br>388</p>
