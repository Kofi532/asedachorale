        <p><br>1 How bright these glorious spirits shine! <br> Whence all their white array? <br> How came they to the blissful seats <br> of everlasting day?<br>2 Lo! these are they from sufferings great <br> who came to realms of light, <br> and in the blood of Christ have washed <br> those robes that shine so bright.<br>3 Now with triumphal palms they stand <br> before the throne on high, <br> and serve the God they love amidst <br> the glories of the sky.<br>4 Hunger and thirst are felt no more, <br> nor sun with scorching ray: <br> God is their sun, whose cheering beams <br> diffuse eternal day.<br>5 The Lamb, who dwells amid the throne, <br> shall o'er them still preside, <br> feed them with nourishment divine, <br> and all their footsteps guide.<br>6 In pastures green he'll lead his flock <br> where living streams appear; <br> and God the Lord from every eye <br> shall wipe off every tear. <br>  <br> Source: Ancient and Modern: hymns and songs for refreshing worship #<br>303a</p>
