HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1. For man the Savior shed <br> His all atoning blood, <br> And, oh, shall ransomed man refuse <br> To suffer for his God? <br> <br>2. Ashamed who now can be <br> To own the Crucified? <br> Nay, rather be our glory this, <br> To die for Him who died? <br> <br>3. So felt Thy martyr, Lord; <br> By Thy right hand sustained, <br> He waged for Thee the battleÂ’s strife, <br> And threatened death disdained. <br> <br>4. Upon the golden crown <br> Gazing with eager breath, <br> He fought as one who fain would die, <br> And, dying, conquer death. <br> <br>5. Alone he stood unmoved <br> Amid his cruel foes; <br> Oh, wondrous was the might that then <br> Above his torturers rose! <br> <br>6. Lord, give us grace to bear <br> Like him our cross of shame, <br> To do and suffer what Thou wilt, <br> For love of Thy dear name. <br> <br>7. Jesu, the king of saints, <br> We praise Thee and adore, <br> Who art, with God the Father One <br> And Spirit evermore. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>1559</p>
