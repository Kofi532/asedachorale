        <p><br>1. O Lamb of God, whose love divine <br> Draws virgin souls to follow Thee; <br> And bids them earthly joys resign <br> If so they may Thy beauty see; <br> <br>2. The saint of whom we sing today <br> Was faithful to Thy loving call, <br> And, casting other hopes away, <br> Took Thee to be her God, her all. <br> <br>3. To Thee she yielded up her will, <br> Her heart was drawn to Thine above; <br> Content if Thou wouldst deign to fill <br> Thine handmaid with Thy perfect love. <br> <br>4. Beneath Thy cross she loved to stand, <br> Like Mary in Thy dying hour, <br> That blessings from Thy pierc√®d hand <br> Might clothe her with undying power; <br> <br>5. With power to win the crown of light <br> For virgin souls laid up on high, <br> And ready keep her lamp at night <br> To hail the Bridegroom drawing nigh. <br> <br>6. And surely Thou at last didst come <br> To end the sorrows of Thy bride, <br> And bear her to Thy peaceful home <br> With Thee for ever to abide. <br> <br>7. All glory, Jesu, for the grace <br> That drew Thy saint to follow Thee; <br> Grant us too in Thy love a place <br> Both now and through eternity. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>5081</p>
