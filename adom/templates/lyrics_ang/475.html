HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1 Behold us, Lord a little space <br> From daily tasks set free, <br> And met within Thy holy place <br> To rest awhile with Thee. <br> <br>2 Around us rolls the ceaseless tide <br> Of business, toil, and care, <br> And scarcely can we turn aside <br> For one brief hour of prayer. <br> <br>3 Yet these are not the only walls <br> Wherein Thou mayst be sought; <br> On homeliest work thy blessing falls <br> In truth and patience wrought. <br> <br>4 Thine is the loom, the forge, the mart, <br> The wealth of land and sea; <br> The worlds of science and of art, <br> Revealed and ruled by Thee. <br> <br>5 Then let us prove our heavenly birth <br> In all we do and know, <br> And claim the kingdom of the earth <br> For Thee, and not thy foe. <br> <br>6 Work shall be prayer, if all be wrought <br> As thou wouldst have it done; <br> And prayer, by thee inspired and taught, <br> Itself with work be one. <br> AMEN. <br>  <br> Source: The A.M.E.
