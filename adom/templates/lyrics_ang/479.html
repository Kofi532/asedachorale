        <p><br>1. Great God, who, hid from mortal sight, <br> Dost dwell in unapproachèd light, <br> Before whose throne with veilèd brow, <br> Thy sinless angels trembling bow. <br> <br>2. A while in darkness here below <br> We lie oppressed with sin and woe; <br> But soon the everlasting day <br> Shall chase the night of gloom away. <br> <br>3. The day prepared for us by Thee; <br> The day reserved for us to see; <br> A day but faintly imaged here <br> By brightest sun at noontide clear. <br> <br>4. Too long, alas! it still delays, <br> It lingers yet, that day of days; <br> The flesh, with all its load of sin, <br> Must perish, ere its joy we win. <br> <br>5. Then from these earthy bonds set free <br> The soul shall fly, O God, to Thee; <br> To see Thee, love Thee, and adore, <br> Her blissful task for evermore. <br> <br>6. All bounteous Trinity! prepare <br> Our souls Thy hidden joy to share, <br> That our brief daytime, used aright, <br> May issue in eternal light. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>1760</p>
