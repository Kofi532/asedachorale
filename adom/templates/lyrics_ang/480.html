        <p><br>1 O Jesus, crucified for man, <br> O Lamb, all glorious on Thy throne, <br> Teach Thou our wondering souls to scan <br> The mystery of Thy love unknown. <br> <br>2 We pray Thee, grant us strength to take <br> Our daily cross, whate'er it be, <br> And gladly for Thine own dear sake <br> In paths of pain to follow Thee. <br> <br>3 As on our daily way we go, <br> Thro' light or shade, in calm or strife, <br> O may we bear Thy marks below <br> In conquered sin and chastened life. <br> <br>4 And week by week this day we ask <br> That holy memories of Thy Cross <br> May sanctify each common task, <br> And turn to gain each earthly loss. <br> <br>5 Grant us, dear Lord, our cross to bear <br> Till at Thy feet we lay it down, <br> Win thro' Thy blood our pardon there, <br> And thro' the cross attain the crown. <br>  <br> Source: The Church Hymnal: containing hymns approved and set forth by the general conventions of <br>1892 and <br>1916; together with hymns for the use of guilds and brotherhoods, and for special occasions (Rev. ed) #<br>5</p>
