        <p><br>1 Christians, sing out with exultation, <br> And praise your Benefactors name! <br> Today the Author of salvation, <br> The Fathers Well-beloved, came. <br> Of undefiled virgin mother <br> An Infant all divine was born, <br> And God Himself became your Brother <br> Upon this happy Christmas morn. <br> <br>2 In Him eternal might and power <br> To human weakness hath inclined; <br> And this poor Child brings richest dower <br> Of gifts and graces to mankind. <br> While here, His majesty disguising, <br> A servants form the Master wears, <br> Behold the beams of glory rising, <br> Een from His poverty and tears. <br> <br>3 A stable serves Him for a dwelling <br> And for a bed a manger mean; <br> Yet oer His head, His advent telling, <br> A new and wondrous star is seen. <br> Angels rehearse to men the story, <br> The joyful story of His birth; <br> To Him they raise the anthem--"Glory <br> To God on high and peace on earth!" <br> <br>4 For thro' this holy incarnation <br> The primal curse is done away; <br> And blessed peace oer all creation <br> Hath shed its pure and gentle ray. <br> Then, in that heav'nly concert joining, <br> O Christian men, with one accord, <br> Your voices tunefully combining, <br> Salute the birthday of your Lord! <br> Amen. <br>  <br> Source: The Lutheran Hymnal #<br>100</p>
