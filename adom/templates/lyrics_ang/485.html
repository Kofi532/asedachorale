HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1 From glory unto glory! Be this our joyous song; <br> As on the King's own highway, We bravely march along. <br> From glory unto glory! O word of stirring cheer, <br> As dawns the solemn brightness of another glad New Year. <br> <br>2 From glory unto glory! What great things He hath done, <br> What wonders He hath shown us, what triumphs He hath won! <br> From glory unto glory! What mighty blessings crown <br> The lives for which our Lord laid His own so freely down! <br> <br>3 The fullness of His blessing encompasseth our way; <br> The fullness of His promises crowns every brightening day; <br> The fullness of His glory is beaming from above, <br> While more and more we learn to know the fullness of His love. <br> <br>4 And closer yet and closer the golden bonds shall be, <br> Uniting all who love our Lord in pure sincerity; <br> And wider yet and wider shall the circling glory glow, <br> As more and more are taught of God that mighty love to know. <br> <br>5 Oh, let our adoration for all that He hath done, <br> Peal out beyond the stars of God, while voice and life are one; <br> And let our consecration be real, deep, and true: <br> Oh, even now our hearts shall bow, and joyful vows renew. <br> <br>6 Now onward, ever onward, from strength to strength we go, <br> While grace for grace abundantly shall from His fullness flow, <br> To glory's full fruition, from glory's foretaste here, <br> Until His very presence crown our happiest New Year. <br> Amen. <br> The Hymnal: revised and enlarged as adopted by the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America in the year of our Lord <br>1892</p>
