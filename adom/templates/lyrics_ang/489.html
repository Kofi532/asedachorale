        <p><br>1. O God, the joy of Heavn above, <br> Thou didst not need Thy creatures love, <br> When from Thy secret place of rest <br> Thy Word the earths foundations blest. <br> <br>2. Thou spakest: worlds began to be; <br> They bow before Thy majesty; <br> And all to their creator raise <br> A wondrous harmony of praise. <br> <br>3. But ere, O Lord, this lovely earth <br> From Thy creative will had birth, <br> Thou in Thy counsels didst unfold <br> Another world of fairer mold. <br> <br>4. That realm shall our Redeemer frame, <br> And build upon His mighty name; <br> His hand the word of power shall sow, <br> That all the earth His truth may know. <br> <br>5. When time itself has passed away, <br> His Church, secure in Heavn for aye, <br> Shall share His table and His throne, <br> And God the Father reign alone. <br> <br>6. O Father, Son, and Spirit blest, <br> One God in Heavn and earth confessed, <br> Preserve, direct, and fill with love <br> Thy realm on earth, Thy realm above. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>4859</p>
