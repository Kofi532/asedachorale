        <p><br>1. Lo! now the time accepted peals <br> Its tidings of release; <br> A time that with salvation heals, <br> And to repentant tears reveals <br> The mercy seat of peace. <br> <br>2. Then let us wisely now restrain <br> Our food, our drink, our sleep; <br> From idle word and jest refrain <br> And steadfastly begin again <br> A stricter watch to keep. <br> <br>3. Now Heavn-taught love will haste to rise <br> And seek the cheerless bed, <br> Where cold and wan the sufferer lies, <br> And Christ Himself to heedful eyes <br> Is hungering for bread. <br> <br>4. Tis now that zealous charity <br> Her goods more largely spends, <br> Lays up her treasure in the sky, <br> And freely yields, ere death draw nigh, <br> To God the wealth He lends. <br> <br>5. Then consecrate us, Lord, anew, <br> And fire our hearts with love; <br> That all we think, and all we do, <br> Within, without, be pure and true, <br> Rekindled from above. <br> <br>6. Now fuller praise and glory be <br> To Thee, the First and Last, <br> And make us, blessèd Trinity, <br> More faithful soldiers, worthier Thee, <br> Through this our chastening fast. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>3872</p>
