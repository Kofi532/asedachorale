        <p><br>1 My Lord, my Master, at thy feet adoring, <br> I see thee bowed beneath thy load of woe: <br> for me, a sinner, is thy life-blood pouring; <br> for thee, my Saviour, scarce my tears will flow. <br> <br>2 Thine own disciple to the Jews has sold thee, <br> with friendship's kiss and loyal word he came; <br> how oft of faithful love my lips have told thee, <br> while thou hast seen my falsehood and my shame! <br> <br>3 With taunts and scoffs they mock what seems thy weakness, <br> with blows and outrage adding pain to pain; <br> thou art unmoved and steadfast in thy meekness; <br> when I am wronged, how quickly I complain! <br> <br>4 My Lord, my Saviour, when I see thee wearing <br> upon thy bleeding brow the crown of thorn, <br> shall I for pleasure live, or shrink from bearing <br> whate'er my lot may be of pain or scorn? <br> <br>5 O victim of thy love! O pangs most healing! <br> O saving death! O wounds that I adore! <br> O shame most glorious! Christ, before thee kneeling, <br> I pray thee keep me thine for evermore. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>140a</p>
