        <p><br>1. O voice of the Belovèd! <br> Thy bride hath heard Thee say, <br> Rise up, My love, My fair one, <br> Arise and come away. <br> For lo, tis past, the winter, <br> The winter of thy year; <br> The rain is past and over, <br> The flowers on earth appear. <br> <br>2. And now the time of singing <br> Is come for every bird; <br> And over all the country <br> The turtle dove is heard; <br> The fig her green fruit ripens, <br> The vines are in their bloom; <br> Arise and smell their fragrance; <br> My love, My fair one, come!; <br> <br>3. Yea, Lord! Thy passion over, <br> We know this life of ours <br> Hath passed from death and winter <br> To leaves and budding flowers; <br> No more Thy rain of weeping <br> In drear Gethsemane; <br> No more the clouds and darkness, <br> That veiled Thy bitter tree. <br> <br>4. Our Easter sun is risen! <br> And yet we slumber long, <br> And need Thy doves sweet pleading <br> To waken prayer and song. <br> Oh breathe upon our deadness, <br> Oh shine upon our gloom; <br> Lord, let us feel Thy presence <br> And rise and live and bloom. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>5496</p>
