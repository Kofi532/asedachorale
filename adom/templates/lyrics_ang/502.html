HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1 To Thee and to Thy Christ, O God, <br> We sing, we ever sing; <br> For He the lonely wine-press trod, <br> Our cup of joy to bring. <br> His glorious arm the strife maintained, <br> He marched in might from far; <br> His robes were with the vintage stained, <br> Red with the wine of war. <br> <br>2 To Thee and to Thy Christ, O God, <br> We sing, we ever sing; <br> For He invaded death's abode, <br> And robbed him of his sting. <br> The house of dust enthralls no more, <br> For He, the Strong to save, <br> Himself doth guard that silent door, <br> Great Keeper of the grave. <br> <br>3 To Thee and to Thy Christ, O God, <br> We sing, we ever sing; <br> For He hath crushed beneath His rod <br> The world's proud rebel king; <br> He plunged in His imperial strength <br> To gulfs of darkness down; <br> He brought His trophy up at length, <br> The foiled usurper's crown. <br> <br>4 To Thee and to Thy Christ, O God, <br> We sing, we ever sing; <br> For He redeemed us with His blood <br> From every evil thing. <br> Thy saving strength His arm upbore, <br> The arm that set us free: <br> Glory, O God, for evermore <br> Be to Thy Christ and Thee. <br> Amen. <br> The Hymnal: Published by the authority of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A., <br>1895</p>
