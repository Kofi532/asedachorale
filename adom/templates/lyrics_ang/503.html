        <p><br>1. Forty days Thy seer of old <br> Communed with Thee, O Most High; <br> Fain Thy glories to behold <br> And Thy glory passing by. <br> <br>2. In the rocky cleft he bowed; <br> Thou, as mortal gaze might bear, <br> Part revealed and part in cloud, <br> Didst Thy secret name declare. <br> <br>3. Forth days of Easter-tide <br> Thou didst commune with Thine own; <br> Now by glimpses, Lord, descried, <br> Handled now and proved and known; <br> <br>4. Known, most Merciful, yet veiled; <br> Else before the awful sight <br> Surely heart and flesh had failed, <br> Smitten with exceeding light. <br> <br>5. Risen Master, fain would we, <br> Sharing those unearthly days, <br> Morn and eve, on shore and sea, <br> Watch Thy movements, mark Thy ways; <br> <br>6. Catch by faith each glad surprise <br> Of Thy footstep drawing nigh, <br> Hear Thy sudden greeting rise <br> Peace be to you! It is I. <br> <br>7. Secrets of Thy kingdom learn, <br> Read the visions open spread, <br> Feel Thy Word within us burn, <br> Know Thee in the broken bread. <br> <br>8. So Thy glorys skirts beside <br> Gently led from grace to grace, <br> We Thy coming may abide, <br> And adore Thee face to face. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>1582</p>
