        <p><br>1. O Jesus, crowned with all renown, <br> since thou the earth hast trod, <br> thou reignest and by thee come down <br> henceforth the gifts of God. <br> Thine is the health and thine the wealth <br> that in our halls abound, <br> and thine the beauty and the joy <br> with which the years are crowned. <br> <br>2. Lord, in their change, let frost and heat, <br> and winds and dews be given; <br> all fostering power, all influence sweet, <br> breathe from the bounteous heaven. <br> Attemper fair with gentle air <br> the sunshine and the rain, <br> that kindly earth with timely birth <br> may yield her fruits again: <br> <br>3. that we may feed the poor aright, <br> and, gathering round thy throne, <br> here, in the holy angel's sight, <br> repay thee of thine own: <br> That we may praise thee all our days, <br> and with the Father's Name, <br> and with the Holy Spirit's gifts, <br> the Savior's love proclaim. <br>  <br> Source: The Hymnal <br>1982: according to the use of the Episcopal Church #<br>292</p>
