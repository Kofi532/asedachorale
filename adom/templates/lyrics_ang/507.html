        <p><br>1. Bounteous Spirit, ever shedding <br> Life the world to fill! <br> Swarms the fruitful globe oerspreading, <br> Shoals their ocean pathway threading, <br> Own Thy quickening thrill: <br> Author of each creatures birth, <br> Life of life beneath the earth, <br> Everywhere, O Spirit blest, <br> Thou art motion, Thou art rest. <br> <br>2. Come, Creator! grace bestowing <br> All Thy sevenfold dower! <br> Come, Thy peace and bounty strowing, <br> Earths renewer! Thine the sowing <br> Thine the gladdening shower. <br> Comforter! what joy Thou art <br> To the blest and faithful heart; <br> But to mans primeval foe <br> Uttermost despair and woe. <br> <br>3. Oer the waters of creation <br> Moved Thy wings divine; <br> When the world, to animation <br> Waking neath Thy visitation, <br> Teemed with powers benign: <br> Thou didst man to being call <br> Didst restore him from his fall; <br> Pouring, like the latter rain, <br> Grace to quicken him again. <br> <br>4. Thine the Gospel voices, crying <br> As with trumpet sound; <br> Till the world, in darkness lying, <br> Rose from deathly sleep, descrying <br> Heavenly light around. <br> Man, to reach that prize revealed, <br> Armed with Thee as with a shield, <br> Nerved and girt his fight to win, <br> Quells the prince of death and sin. <br> <br>5. Lowliest homage now before Thee <br> Let the ransomed pay; <br> For Thy wondrous gifts adore Thee, <br> By Thy holiness implore Thee, <br> While in love they pray: <br> Holy! Holy! we repeat, <br> Kneeling at Thy mercy seat; <br> There unbosom every woe, <br> Groanings Thou alone canst know. <br> <br>6. Fount of grace for every nation, <br> Refuge of the soul! <br> Strengthen Thou each new creation, <br> With the waters of salvation <br> Make the guilty whole: <br> Rule on earth the powers that be; <br> Give us priests inspired of Thee; <br> Through Thy holy Church increase <br> Purest unity and peace. <br> <br>7. Purge and sanctify us wholly <br> From the leaven of ill; <br> Save from Satans grasp unholy; <br> To a living faith and lowly <br> Mould the upright will; <br> Till the olden zeal return, <br> And with mutual love we burn; <br> Till in peace, no more to roam, <br> All the flock be gathered home. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>655</p>
