        <p><br>1. Glorious is Thy name, O Lord! <br> HeavÂ’n and earth with one accord <br> Tell Thy greatness, part revealed, <br> But the larger part concealed. <br> How shall we poor singers dare <br> Seek Thy face in praise and prayer? <br> <br>2. Fearful is Thy name, O Lord! <br> Dread Thy voice and sharp Thy sword; <br> Thunders roll around Thy path; <br> None can stand before Thy wrath! <br> How shall trembling sinners dare <br> Lift their voice in praise and prayer? <br> <br>3. Yet with all Thy wondrous might <br> Far beyond our mortal sight, <br> Perfect wisdom, boundless powers, <br> Thou, O glorious God! art ours. <br> So, though filled with awe, we dare <br> Name Thy name in praise and prayer. <br> <br>4. Since, to save a world undone, <br> Thou didst give Thine only Son, <br> All Thy greatness, Lord Most High, <br> Brings Thee to our hearts more nigh. <br> Thus in faith and hope we dare <br> Claim Thy love in praise and prayer. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>1794</p>
