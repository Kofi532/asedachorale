        <p><br>1 Before Jehovah's aweful throne, <br> ye nations, bow with sacred joy; <br> know that the Lord is God alone: <br> he can create, and he destroy.<br>2 His sovereign power, without our aid, <br> made us of clay, and formed us then; <br> and, when like wandering sheep we strayed, <br> he brought us to his fold again.<br>3 We'll crowd thy gates with thankful songs, <br> high as the heavens our voices raise; <br> and earth, with her ten thousand tongues, <br> shall fill thy courts with sounding praise.<br>4 Wide as the world is thy command, <br> vast as eternity thy love; <br> firm as a rock thy truth must stand, <br> when rolling years shall cease to move. <br>  <br> Source: Ancient and Modern: hymns and songs for refreshing worship #<br>597</p>
