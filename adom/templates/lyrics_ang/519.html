God the FatherÂ’s only Son, <br> And with Him in glory One, <br> One in wisdom, One in might, <br> Absolute and infinite; <br> Jesu, I believe in thee, <br> Thou art Lord and God to me. <br> <br>2. Preacher of eternal peace, <br> Christ anointed to release, <br> Setting wide the dungeon door, <br> Unto sinners chained before; <br> Jesu, I believe in Thee, <br> Christ the Prophet sent to me. <br> <br>3. Low in deep Gethsemane, <br> High on dreadful Calvary, <br> In the garden, on the cross, <br> Making good our utter loss; <br> Jesu, I believe in Thee, <br> Priest and Sacrifice for me. <br> <br>4. Ruler of Thy ransomed race, <br> And Protector by Thy grace, <br> Leader in the way we wend, <br> And Rewarder at the end; <br> Jesu, I believe in Thee, <br> Christ, the King of kings to me. <br> <br>5. Light revealed through clouds of pain, <br> That the blind might see again; <br> Love content in death to lie, <br> That the dead might never die: <br> Jesu, I believe in Thee, <br> Light and Love and Life to me. <br> <br>6. All that I am fain to know <br> While I watch and wait below: <br> All that I would find above, <br> Length and depth and height of love: <br> Jesu, I believe in Thee, <br> Thou art All in All to me. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>1924</p>
