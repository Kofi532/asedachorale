        <p><br>1 Great God, what do I see and hear! <br> The end of things created! <br> The Judge of mankind doth appear <br> on clouds of glory seated! <br> The trumpet sounds; the graves restore <br> the dead which they contained before: <br> prepare, my soul, to meet him. <br> <br>2 The dead in Christ shall first arise, <br> at the last trumpet's sounding, <br> caught up to meet him in the skies, <br> with joy their Lord surrounding; <br> no gloomy fears their souls dismay; <br> his presence sheds eternal day <br> on those prepared to meet him. <br> <br>3 But sinners, filled with guilty fears, <br> behold his wrath prevailing; <br> for they shall rise, and find their tears <br> and sighs are unavailing: <br> the day of grace is past and gone; <br> trembling, they stand before the throne, <br> all unprepared to meet him. <br> <br>4 Great God, what do I see and hear! <br> The end of things created! <br> The Judge of mankind doth appear <br> on clouds of glory seated! <br> Beneath his cross I view the day <br> when heav'n and earth shall pass away, <br> and thus prepare to meet him. <br>  <br> Source: Trinity Psalter Hymnal #<br>389</p>
