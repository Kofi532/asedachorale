        <p><br>1. Thrice-holy name! that sweeter sounds <br> Than streams which down the valley run, <br> And tells of more than human love, <br> And more than human power, in one: <br> First from the gracious herald heard, <br> Heard since through all the choirs on high; <br> O child of Mary, Son of God, <br> Eternal, hear Thy childrens cry! <br> While at the blessèd name we bow, <br> Lord Jesus, be among us now! <br> <br>2. Within our dim-eyed souls call up <br> The vision of Thine earthly years; <br> The mount of the transfigured form; <br> The garden of the bitter tears; <br> The cross upreared in darkening skies; <br> The thorn-wreathed head, the bleeding side; <br> And whisper in the heart, For you, <br> For you, I left the Heavns, and died, <br> While at the blessèd name we bow, <br> Lord Jesus, be among us now! <br> <br>3. Ah! with faiths inward piercing eye <br> The riven rock-hewn bed we see, <br> Whence Thou in triumph hast gone forth <br> By death from death to make us free! <br> And when on earths last awful day <br> The judgment-seat of God shall shine, <br> Lift Thou our trembling eyes to read <br> In Thy dear face the mercy-sign. <br> While at the blessèd name we bow, <br> Lord Jesus, be among us now! <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>6664</p>
