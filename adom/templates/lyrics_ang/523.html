        <p><br>1 Who is this, so weak and helpless, <br> child of lowly Hebrew maid, <br> rudely in a stable sheltered, <br> coldly in a manger laid? <br> 'Tis the Lord of all creation, <br> who this wondrous path has trod; <br> he is God from everlasting, <br> and to everlasting God. <br> <br>2 Who is this, a Man of Sorrows, <br> walking sadly life's hard way, <br> homeless, weary, sighing, weeping <br> over sin and Satan's sway? <br> 'Tis our God, our glorious Savior, <br> who above the starry sky <br> is for us a place preparing, <br> where no tear can dim the eye. <br> <br>3 Who is this? Behold him shedding <br> drops of blood upon the ground! <br> Who is this, despised, rejected, <br> mocked, insulted, beaten, bound? <br> 'Tis our God, who gifts and graces <br> on his church is pouring down; <br> who shall smite in holy vengeance <br> all his foes beneath his throne. <br> <br>4 Who is this that hangs there dying <br> while the rude world scoffs and scorns, <br> numbered with the malefactors, <br> torn with nails, and crowned with thorns? <br> 'Tis our God, who lives forever <br> 'mid the shining ones on high, <br> in the glorious golden city, <br> reigning everlastingly. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Trinity Psalter Hymnal #<br>330</p>
