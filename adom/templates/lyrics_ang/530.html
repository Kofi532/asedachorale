        <p><br>1. The voice of Gods creation found me <br> Perplexed midst hope and fear, <br> For though His sunshine flashed around me, <br> His storms at times drew near: <br> And I said <br> Oh! that I knew where He abideth! <br> For doubts beset our lot, <br> And lo! His glorious face He hideth, <br> And men perceive it not! <br> <br>2. The Voice of Gods Protection told me <br> He loveth all He made; <br> I seemed to feel His arms enfold me, <br> And yet was half afraid: <br> And I said <br> Oh! that I knew where I might find Him! <br> His eye would guide me right: <br> He leaveth countless tracks behind Him, <br> Yet passeth out of sight. <br> <br>3. The voice of conscience sounded nearer, <br> It stirred my inmost breast; <br> But though its tones were firmer, clearer, <br> Twas not the voice of rest: <br> And I said <br> Oh! that I knew if He forgiveth! <br> My soul is faint within, <br> Because in grievous fear it liveth <br> Of wages due to sin. <br> <br>4. It was the voice of revelation <br> That met my utmost need; <br> The wondrous message of salvation <br> Was joy and peace indeed: <br> And I said <br> Oh! how I love the sacred pages <br> From which such tidings flow, <br> As monarchs, patriarchs, poets, sages, <br> Have longed in vain to know! <br> <br>5. For now is life a lucid story, <br> And death a rest in Him, <br> And all is bathed in light and glory <br> That once was dark or dim: <br> And I said <br> O Thou who dost my soul deliver, <br> And all its hopes uplift; <br> Give me a tongue praise the Giver, <br> A heart to prize the gift. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>7064</p>
