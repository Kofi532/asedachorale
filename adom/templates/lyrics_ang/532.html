        <p><br>1 Church of the living God, <br> pillar and ground of truth, <br> keep the old paths the fathers trod <br> in thy illumined youth. <br> <br>2 Lo, in thy bosom lies <br> the touchstone for the age; <br> seducing error shrinks and dies <br> at light from yonder page. <br> <br>3 Woe to the hands that dare, <br> by lust of power enticed, <br> to mingle with the doctrine there <br> the frauds of Antichrist. <br> <br>4 Once to the saints was given <br> all blessèd gospel lore; <br> there, written down in words from heaven, <br> thou hast it evermore. <br> <br>5 Fear not, though doubts abound, <br> and scoffing tongues deride; <br> love of Gods word finds surer ground <br> when to the utmost tried. <br> <br>6 Toil at thy sacred text; <br> more fruitful grows the field; <br> each generation to the next <br> prepares a richer yield. <br> <br>7 Gods Spirit in the church, <br> still lives unspent, untired, <br> inspiring hearts that fain would search <br> the truths Himself inspired. <br> <br>8 Move, Holy Ghost, with might <br> amongst us as of old; <br> dispel the falsehood, and unite <br> in true faith and true fold. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>301</p>
