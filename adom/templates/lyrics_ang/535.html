        <p><br>1 Lord, it belongs not to my care <br> whether I die or live: <br> to love and serve thee is my share, <br> and this thy grace must give.<br>2 Christ leads me through no darker rooms <br> than he went through before; <br> he that into God's kingdom comes <br> must enter by this door.<br>3 Come, Lord, when grace hath made me meet <br> thy blessed face to see; <br> for if thy work on earth be sweet, <br> what will thy glory be!<br>4 Then shall I end my sad complaints <br> and weary, sinful days, <br> and join with the triumphant saints <br> that sing my Saviour's praise.<br>5 My knowledge of that life is small, <br> the eye of faith is dim; <br> but 'tis enough that Christ knows all, <br> and I shall be with him. <br>  <br> Source: Ancient and Modern: hymns and songs for refreshing worship #<br>306</p>
