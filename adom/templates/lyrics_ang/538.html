        <p><br>1 They whose course on earth is oer, <br> think they of their brethren more? <br> They before the throne who bow, <br> feel they for their brethren now? <br> <br>2 We by enemies distrest, <br> they in paradise at rest; <br> we the captives, they the freed  <br> we and they are one indeed. <br> <br>3 Those whom many a land divides, <br> many mountains, many tides, <br> have they with each other part, <br> fellowship of heart with heart? <br> <br>4 Each to each may be unknown, <br> wide apart their lots be thrown; <br> differing tongues their lips may speak, <br> one be strong, and one be weak: <br> <br>5 yet in sacrament and prayer <br> each with other hath a share; <br> hath a share in tear and sigh, <br> watch and fast and litany. <br> <br>6 Saints departed even thus <br> hold communion still with us; <br> still with us, beyond the veil <br> praising, pleading, without fail. <br> <br>7 With them still our hearts we raise, <br> share their work and join their praise, <br> rendering worship, thanks, and love, <br> to the Trinity above. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>699</p>
