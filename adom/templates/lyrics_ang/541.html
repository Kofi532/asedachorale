        <p><br>1 We are soldiers of Christ, who is mighty to save, <br> and his banner the cross is unfurled; <br> we are pledged to be faithful and steadfast and brave <br> against Satan, the flesh, and the world. <br> <br>2 We are brothers and comrades, we stand side by side, <br> and our faith and our hope are the same; <br> and we think of the cross on which Jesus has died, <br> when we bear the reproach of his name. <br> <br>3 At the font we were marked with the cross on our brow, <br> of our grace and our calling the sign; <br> and the weakest is strong to be true to his vow, <br> for the armour we wear is divine. <br> <br>4 We will watch ready armed if the tempter draw near, <br> if he comes with a frown or a smile; <br> we will heed not his threats, nor his flatteries hear, <br> nor be taken by storm or by wile. <br> <br>5 We will master the flesh, and its longings restrain, <br> we will not be the bond-slaves of sin, <br> the pure Spirit of God in our nature shall reign, <br> and our spirits their freedom shall win. <br> <br>6 For the worlds love we live not, its hate we defy, <br> and we will not be led by the throng; <br> well be true to ourselves, to our Father on high, <br> and the bright world to which we belong. <br> <br>7 Now let each cheer his comrade, let hearts beat as one, <br> while we follow where Christ leads the way; <br> twere dishonour to yield, or the battle to shun, <br> we will fight, and will watch, and will pray. <br> <br>8 Though the warfare be weary, the trial be sore, <br> in the might of our God we will stand; <br> Oh! What joy to be crowned and be pure evermore, <br> in the peace of our own fatherland. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>440</p>
