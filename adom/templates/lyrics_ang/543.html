HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1. Theres peace and rest in paradise, <br> In weary hours we say; <br> And oh that we had wings like doves <br> That we might flee away! <br> <br>2. For here so strong the evil seems, <br> So weak appears the good, <br> Our standard wavers in the rush <br> Of evil, like a flood. <br> <br>3. At times, through the long lonely watch, <br> Nor sun nor moon appears; <br> Without, incessant fightings are, <br> Within, incessant fears. <br> <br>4. Then for the quiet land we long, <br> And the abode of peace; <br> And for the word, Come, weary soul, <br> From war and vigil cease! <br> <br>5. But in our stronger hours we grasp <br> The warriors sword again, <br> And burn the good fight yet to fight, <br> The faithful watch maintain. <br> <br>6. We fain would tread the famous way <br> Martyrs and saints have trod; <br> The hours ebb fast of this one day <br> Of noblest war for God! <br> <br>7. The Lord Himself hath need of us; <br> On! till the fight be won; <br> And the Kings words shall thrill the heart: <br> Servant of God, well done! <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>6887</p>
