        <p><br>1 Children of the heavenly King, <br> As we journey let us sing; <br> Sing our Saviors worthy praise, <br> Glorious in His works and ways, <br> Glorious in His works and ways. <br> <br>2 We are traveling home to God, <br> In the way our fathers trod; <br> They are happy now, and we <br> Soon their happiness shall see, <br> Soon their happiness shall see. <br> <br>3 Fear not, brethren; joyful stand <br> On the borders of our land; <br> Jesus Christ, our Fathers Son, <br> Bids us undismayed go on, <br> Bids us undismayed go on. <br> <br>4 Lord, obediently we'll go, <br> Gladly leaving all below; <br> Only Thou our leader be, <br> And we still will follow Thee, <br> And we still will follow Thee. <br> Amen. <br>  <br> Source: African Methodist Episcopal Church Hymnal #<br>526</p>
