HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1 Angel voices ever singing <br> round Thy throne of light, <br> angel harps, forever ringing, <br> rest not day nor night; <br> thousands only live to bless Thee <br> and confess thee Lord of might. <br> <br>2 Thou who art beyond the farthest <br> mortal eye can scan, <br> can it be that Thou regardest <br> songs of sinful man? <br> Can we feel that Thou art near us <br> and wilt hear us? Yea, we can. <br> <br>3 Yea, we know Thy love rejoices <br> o'er each work of Thine; <br> Thou didst ears and hands and voices <br> for Thy praise combine; <br> craftsman's art and music's measure <br> for Thy pleasure didst design. <br> <br>4 Here, great God, today we offer <br> of Thine own to Thee; <br> and for Thine acceptance proffer, <br> all unworthily, <br> hearts and minds and hands and voices <br> in our choicest melody. <br> <br>5 Honor, glory, might, and merit <br> Thine shall ever be, <br> Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, <br> blessed Trinity: <br> of the best that Thou hast given <br> earth and heaven render Thee. <br>  <br> Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God #<br>165</p>
