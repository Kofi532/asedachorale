        <p><br>1 Lord, enthroned in heav'nly splendor, <br> first-begotten from the dead, <br> Thou alone, our strong Defender, <br> liftest up Thy people's head. <br> Hallelujah! Hallelujah! <br> Jesus, true and living Bread! <br> <br>2 Prince of Life, for us Thou livest, <br> by Thy body souls are healed; <br> Prince of Peace, Thy peace Thou givest, <br> by Thy blood is pardon sealed. <br> Hallelujah! Hallelujah! <br> Word of God in flesh revealed. <br> <br>3 Paschal Lamb! Thine off'ring finished <br> once for all when Thou wast slain, <br> in its fullness undiminished <br> shall forevermore remain. <br> Hallelujah! Hallelujah! <br> Cleansing souls from every stain. <br> <br>4 Great High Priest of our profession, <br> thro' the veil Thou ent'redst in; <br> by Thy mighty intercession <br> grace and mercy Thou dost win. <br> Hallelujah! Hallelujah! <br> Only sacrifice for sin. <br> <br>5 Life-imparting heav'nly Manna, <br> stricken Rock, with streaming side, <br> heav'n and earth with loud hosanna <br> worship Thee, the Lamb who died. <br> Hallelujah! Hallelujah! <br> Ris'n, ascended, glorified! <br>  <br> Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God #<br>303</p>
