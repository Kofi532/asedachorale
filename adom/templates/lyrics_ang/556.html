        <p><br>1 Victim Divine, thy grace we claim <br> while thus thy precious death we show: <br> once offered up, a spotless Lamb, <br> in thy great temple here below, <br> thou didst for all our kind atone, <br> and standest now before the throne. <br> <br>2 Thou standest in the holiest place, <br> as now for guilty sinners slain; <br> thy blood of sprinkling speaks, and prays, <br> all prevalent for helpless ones; <br> thy blood is still our ransom found, <br> and speaks salvation all around. <br> <br>3 The smoke of thy atonement here <br> darkened the sun and rent the veil, <br> made the new way to heaven appear, <br> and showed the great Invisible; <br> well pleased in thee our God looked down, <br> and called his rebels to a crown. <br> <br>4 He still respects thy sacrifice, <br> its savor sweet doth always please; <br> the offering smokes through earth and skies, <br> diffusing life, and joy, and peace; <br> to these thy lower courts it comes, <br> and fills them with divine perfumes. <br> <br>5 We need not go up to heaven, <br> to bring the long-sought Savior down; <br> thou art to all already given, <br> thou dost eÂ’en now thy banquet crown: <br> To every faithful soul appear, <br> and show thy real presence here! <br>  <br> Source: Sing the Faith #<br>2259</p>
