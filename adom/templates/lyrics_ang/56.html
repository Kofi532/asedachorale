        <p><br>1 O come, Redeemer of mankind, appear, <br> thee with full hearts the Virgin-born we greet; <br> let every age with rapt amazement hear <br> that wondrous birth which for our God is meet. <br> <br>2 Not by the will of man, or mortal seed, <br> but by the Spirits breathed mysterious grace <br> the Word of God became our flesh indeed, <br> and grew a tender plant of human race. <br> <br>3 Lo! Marys virgin womb its burthen bears, <br> nor less abides her virgin purity; <br> in the Kings glory see our nature shares; <br> here in his temple God vouchsafes to be. <br> <br>4 From his bright chamber, virtues holy shrine <br> the royal Bridegroom cometh to the day; <br> of twofold substance, human and divine, <br> as giant swift, rejoicing on His way. <br> <br>5 Forth from his Father to the world he goes, <br> back to the Fathers face his way regains, <br> far down to souls beneath his glory shows, <br> again at Gods right hand victorious reigns. <br> <br>6 With the Eternal Father equal, thou, <br> girt with our flesh dost triumph evermore, <br> strengthening our feeble bodies here below <br> with endless grace from thine own living store. <br> <br>7 How doth thy lowly manger radiant shine! <br> On the sweet breath of night new splendour grows; <br> so may our spirits glow with faith Divine, <br> where no dark cloud of sin shall interpose. <br> <br>8 All praise and glory to the Father be, <br> all praise and glory to his only son, <br> all praise and glory, Holy Ghost, to thee, <br> both now, and while eternal ages run. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>81</p>
