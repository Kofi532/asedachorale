        <p><br>1 O Father, bless the children <br> Brought hither to Thy gate; <br> Lift up their fallen nature, <br> Restore their lost estate; <br> Renew Thy image in them, <br> And own them, by this sign, <br> Thy very sons and daughters, <br> New born of birth divine. <br> <br>2 O Jesu, Lord, receive them; <br> Thy loving arms of old <br> Were opened wide to welcome <br> The children to Thy fold; <br> Let these, baptized, and dying, <br> Then rising from the dead, <br> Henceforth be living members <br> Of Thee, their living Head. <br> <br>3 O Holy Spirit, keep them; <br> Dwell with them to the last, <br> Till all the fight is ended, <br> And all the storms are past. <br> Renew the gift baptismal, <br> From strength to strength, till each, <br> The troublous waves o'ercoming, <br> The land of life shall reach. <br> <br>4 O Father, Son, and Spirit, <br> O Wisdom, Love, and Power, <br> We wait the promised blessing <br> In this accepted hour! <br> We name upon the children <br> The Threefold Name divine; <br> Receive them, cleanse them, own them, <br> And keep them ever Thine. <br> Amen. <br> The Hymnal: revised and enlarged as adopted by the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America in the year of our Lord <br>1892</p>
