        <p><br>1 O Christ, Redeemer of our race, <br> thou brightness of the Fathers face, <br> of him, and with him ever one, <br> ere times and seasons had begun; <br> <br>2 thou art that very Light of light, <br> unfailing hope in sins dark night, <br> hear thou the prayers thy people pray, <br> The wide world oer, this blessèd day. <br> <br>3 Remember, Lord of life and grace, <br> how once, to save a ruined race, <br> thou didst our very flesh assume <br> in Marys undefilèd womb. <br> <br>4 Today, as year by year its light <br> sheds oer the world a radiance bright, <br> one precious truth is echoed on, <br> tis thou hast saved us, thou alone. <br> <br>5 Thou from the Fathers throne didst come <br> to call his banished children home; <br> and heavn, and earth, and sea, and shore <br> his love who sent thee here adore. <br> <br>6 And gladsome too are we today, <br> whose guilt thy blood has washed away; <br> redeemed the new-made song we sing; <br> it is the birthday of our King. <br> <br>7 O Lord, the virgin-born, to thee <br> eternal praise and glory be, <br> whom with the Father we adore <br> and Holy Ghost forevermore. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>79</p>
