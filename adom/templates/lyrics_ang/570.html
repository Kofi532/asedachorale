        <p><br>1 Every morn the golden sun <br> Rises warm and bright; <br> But the evening cometh on, <br> And the cold, dark night: <br> Theres a bright land far away <br> Where tis never ending day. <br> <br>2 Every sprint the sweet young flowrs <br> Open fresh and gay, <br> Till the chilly autumn hours <br> Wither them away! <br> Theres a land we have not seen, <br> Where the trees are always green. <br> <br>3 Little birds sing songs of praise <br> All the summer long. <br> But in colder, shorter days <br> They forget their song: <br> Theres a place where angels sing <br> Ceaseless praises to their King. <br> <br>4 Christ our Lord is ever near <br> Those who follow Him! <br> But we cannot see Him here, <br> For our eyes are dim: <br> There is a most happy place, <br> Where well always see His face. <br> <br>5 Who shall go to that fair land? <br> All who love the right: <br> Holy children there shall stand, <br> In their robes of white; <br> In that heavn so bright and blest, <br> Is our everlasting rest. <br>  <br> Source: Hymns We Love, for Sunday Schools and All Devotional Meetings #<br>81</p>
