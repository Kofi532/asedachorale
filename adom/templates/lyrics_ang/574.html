        <p><br>1 Hushed was the evening hymn, <br> the temple courts were dark; <br> the lamp was burning dim <br> before the sacred ark; <br> when suddenly a Voice Divine <br> rang through the silence of the shrine. <br> <br>2 The old man, meek and mild, <br> the priest of Israel, slept; <br> his watch the Temple child, <br> the little Levite, kept; <br> and what from Elis sense was sealed <br> the Lord to Hannahs son revealed. <br> <br>3 Oh! give me Samuels ear, <br> the open ear, O Lord, <br> alive and quick to hear <br> each whisper of thy word; <br> like him to answer at yhy call, <br> and to obey thee first of all. <br> <br>4 Oh! give me Samuels heart, <br> a lowly heart, that waits <br> where in thy house thou art, <br> or watches at thy gates; <br> ny day and night, a heart that still <br> moves at the breathing of thy will. <br> <br>5 Oh! give me Samuels mind, <br> a sweet unmurmuring faith, <br> obedient and resigned <br> to thee in life and death; <br> that I may read with child-like eyes <br> truths that are hidden from the wise. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>18</p>
