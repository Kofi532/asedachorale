        <p><br>1. Within the churchyard, side by side, <br> Are many long low graves; <br> And some have stones set over them, <br> On some the green grass waves. <br> <br>2. Full many a little Christian child, <br> Woman, and man, lies there; <br> And we pass near them every time <br> When we go in to prayer. <br> <br>3. They cannot hear our footsteps come, <br> They do not see us pass; <br> They cannot feel the warm bright sun <br> That shines upon the grass. <br> <br>4. They do not hear when the great bell <br> Is ringing overhead; <br> They cannot rise and come to church <br> With us, for they are dead. <br> <br>5. But we believe a day shall come <br> When all the dead will rise, <br> When they who sleep down in the grass, <br> Will ope again their eyes. <br> <br>6. For Christ our Lord was buried once, <br> He died and rose again, <br> He conquered death, He left the grave; <br> And so will Christian men. <br> <br>7. So when the friends we love the best <br> Lie in their churchyard bed, <br> We must not cry too bitterly <br> Over the happy dead; <br> <br>8. Because, for our dear Saviors sake, <br> Our sins are all forgivn; <br> And Christians only fall asleep <br> To wake again in Heavn. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>7152</p>
