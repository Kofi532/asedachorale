        <p><br>1. Lord of Life, prophetic Spirit, <br> In sweet measure evermore <br> To the holy children dealing <br> Each his gift from Thy rich store; <br> Bless Thy family, adoring <br> As in Israels schools of yore. <br> <br>2. Holy Jesus, Eye most loving, <br> On each young disciple bent; <br> Voice that, seeming earthly, summoned <br> Samuel to the awful tent; <br> Hand that cast Elijahs mantle; <br> Thine be all Thy grace hath lent. <br> <br>3. As to Thine own seventy scholars <br> Thou of old Thine arm didst reach, <br> Under Thy majestic shadow <br> Guiding them to do and teach, <br> Till their hour of solemn unction; <br> So be with us all and each. <br> <br>4. God and Father of all spirits, <br> Whose dread call young Joshua knew, <br> Forty days in darkness waiting <br> With Thy servant good and true, <br> Thence to wage Thy war descending, <br> Own us, Lord, Thy champions, too. <br> <br>5. One Thy light, the temple filling, <br> Holy, holy, holy Three; <br> Meanest men and brightest angels <br> Wait alike the word from Thee; <br> Highest musings, lowliest worship, <br> Must their preparation be. <br> <br>6. Now Thou speakesthear we trembling <br> From the glory comes a voice. <br> Who accepts thAlmightys mission? <br> Who will make Christs work his choice? <br> Who for Us proclaim to sinners, <br> Turn, believe, endure, rejoice? <br> <br>7. Here are we, Redeemer, send us! <br> But because Thy work is fire, <br> And our lips, unclean and earthly, <br> Breathe no breath of high desire; <br> Send Thy seraph from the altar <br> Veiled, but in his bright attire. <br> <br>8. Cause him, Lord, to fly full swiftly <br> With the mystic coal in hand, <br> Sin consuming, soul transforming, <br> (Faith and love will understand); <br> Touch our lips, Thou awful Mercy <br> With Thine own keen healing brand. <br> <br>9. Thou didst come that fire to kindle; <br> Fain would we Thy torches prove, <br> Far and wide Thy beacons lighting <br> With thundying spark of love: <br> Only feed our flame, we pray Thee, <br> With Thy breathings from above. <br> <br>10. Now to God, the souls Creator, <br> To His Word and wisdom sure, <br> To His all enlightening Spirit, <br> Patron of the frail and poor, <br> Three in One, be praise and glory, <br> Here and while the heavns endure. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>3853</p>
