        <p><br>1. Thou, who didst call Thy saints of old <br> Thy chosen flock to teach, <br> Who madst the fearful hearted bold, <br> And quick the slow of speech; <br> Still Thou dost ask whom Thou shalt send <br> And who will go for Thee, <br> To feed Thy lambs, Thy sheep to tend; <br> Lord, here am I; send me. <br> <br>2. O send useen as Thou, O Lord, <br> Wast by the Father sent <br> To speak Thine own absolving word <br> To sinners penitent; <br> To wash Thy chosen in the flood <br> Whereby new birth is given; <br> To minister the sacred Food, <br> The Bread of Life from Heavn. <br> <br>3. And Thou, who didst by prophets deign <br> To speak the will divine, <br> That we may never speak in vain, <br> May all our words be Thine; <br> Oh, teach us, Holy Ghost, that we <br> Thine heritage may teach; <br> Bid us to prophesy for Thee, <br> And in Thy power to preach. <br> <br>4. So may we, though unworthy still, <br> Most Holy Trinity, <br> Thy prophets, pastors, priests, fulfill <br> Our sacred ministry; <br> That, when beside the crystal sea <br> We lay our office down, <br> The souls that we have trained for Thee <br> May be our joy and crown. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>6994</p>
