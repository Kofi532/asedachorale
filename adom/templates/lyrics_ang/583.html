HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1. The call to arms is sounding, <br> The foemen muster strong; <br> While saints beneath the altar <br> Are crying, Lord, how long? <br> The living and the loving <br> Christs royal standard raise, <br> And marching on to conflict <br> Shout forth their captains praise. <br> <br>2. No time for self-indulgence, <br> For resting by the way; <br> Repose will come at even, <br> But toil is for the day; <br> Work, like the blessèd Jesus, <br> Who from His earliest youth <br> Would do His Fathers business <br> And witness for the truth. <br> <br>3. For the one Faith, the true Faith, <br> The Faith which cannot fail, <br> For the one Church, the true Church, <br> Gainst which no foes prevail; <br> Made one with God incarnate, <br> We in His might must win <br> The glory of self-conquest, <br> Of victory over sin. <br> <br>4. Behold! upon Mount Sion <br> A glorious people stand, <br> A crown on every forehead, <br> A palm in every hand; <br> Lo! these are they who boldly <br> The name of Christ confessed, <br> And now triumphant praise Him <br> In Heavns unresting rest. <br> <br>5. O Jesu! who art waiting <br> Thy faithful ones to crown, <br> Vouchsafe to bless our conflict, <br> Our loving service own; <br> Come in each heart forever <br> As king adored to reign, <br> Till we with saints triumphant <br> Uplift the victor strain. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>724</p>
