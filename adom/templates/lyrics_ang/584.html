        <p><br>1. Sons of labor, dear to Jesus, <br> To your homes and work again; <br> Go with brave hearts back to duty, <br> Face the peril, bear the pain. <br> Be your dwellings neer so lowly, <br> Yet remember, by your bed, <br> That the Son of God most holy <br> Had not where to lay His head. <br> <br>2. Sons of labor, think of Jesus <br> As you rest your homes within, <br> Think of that sweet babe of Mary <br> In the stable of the inn. <br> Think how in the sacred story <br> Jesus took a humble grade, <br> And the Lord of life and glory <br> Worked with Joseph at His trade. <br> <br>3. Sons of labor, pray to Jesus; <br> Oh, how Jesus prayed for you! <br> In the moonlight, on the mountain, <br> Where the shimmering olives grew. <br> When you rise up at the dawning, <br> Ere in toil you wend your way, <br> Pray, as He prayed, in the morning, <br> Long before the break of day. <br> <br>4. Sons of labor, be like Jesus, <br> Undefilèd, chaste, and pure; <br> And, though Satan tempt you sorely, <br> By His grace you shall endure. <br> Husband, father, son and brother, <br> Be ye gentle, just and true <br> Be ye kind to one another, <br> As the Lord is kind to you. <br> <br>5. Sons of labor, seek for Jesus, <br> Where He tells you ye shall find, <br> In the children, mid the mourners, <br> In the sick, poor, lame and blind <br> Search the Scriptures, He entreats you, <br> For of Me they testify; <br> Love His altar, where He meets you, <br> Saying, Fear notIt is I. <br> <br>6. Sons of labor, go to Jesus, <br> In your sorrow, shame and loss; <br> He is nearest, you are dearest, <br> When you bravely bear His cross. <br> Go to Him, who died to save you, <br> And is still the sinners friend; <br> And the great love, which forgave you, <br> Will forgive you to the end. <br> <br>7. Sons of labor, live for Jesus, <br> Be your work your worship, too; <br> In His name, and to His glory, <br> Do whateer you find to do; <br> Till this night of sin and sorrow <br> Be for ever overpast; <br> And we see the golden morrow, <br> Home with Jesus, home at last! <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>6219</p>
