        <p><br>1 Lord of the harvest, it is right and meet, <br> That we should lay oblations at Thy feet, <br> With joyful Alleluia! <br> <br>2 Sweet is the praise that follows toil and prayer; <br> Sweet is the worship what with heaven we share, <br> Who sing the Alleluia! <br> <br>3 We toiled and prayed and Thou hast heard on high; <br> Hast cheered our hearts and changed our suppliant cry <br> To festal Alleluia! <br> <br>4 So sing we now in tune with that great song, <br> That all the age of ages shall prolong, <br> The endless Alleluia! <br> <br>5 To Thee, O Lord of harvest, Who hast heard, <br> And to Thy white-robed reapers given the word, <br> We sing our Alleluia! <br> <br>6 O Christ, Who in the wide world's fallow lea, <br> Hast sown in blood the precious seed, to Thee <br> We sing our Alleluia! <br> <br>7 To Thee, O Holy Ghost, Whose gracious rain <br> And living breath hast fed the ghostly grain, <br> We sing our Alleluia! <br> <br>8 Yea, West and East, the Harvest men went forth; <br> "We come" has sounded to the South and North. <br> At morn sing Alleluia! <br> <br>9 In fields of home, in fields the far away, <br> Toilers for Jesus hail the golden day. <br> At morn sing Alleluia! <br> <br>10 The winds of God have blown with living breath, <br> His dews have fallen on the plains of death. <br> At eve sing Alleluia! <br> <br>11 Yea, for sweet hope fulfilled, new hope begun, <br> Sing Alleluia to the Three in One, <br> Adoring Alleluia! <br> <br>12 Glory to God! the Church in patience cries; <br> Glory to God! the Church in bliss replies, <br> With endless Alleluia! <br> Amen. <br> The Hymnal: revised and enlarged as adopted by the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America in the year of our Lord <br>1892</p>
