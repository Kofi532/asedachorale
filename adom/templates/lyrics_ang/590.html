        <p><br>1 Unchanging God, hear from eternal heaven: <br> We plead Thy gifts of grace, forever given, <br> Thy call, without repentance, calling still, <br> The sure election of Thy sov'reign will. <br> <br>2 Out of our faith in Thee, who canst not lie, <br> Out of our hearts desire, goes up the cry, <br> From hopes sweet vision of the thing to be, <br> From love to those who still are loved by Thee. <br> <br>3 Bring Thy beloved back, Thine Israel, <br> Thine own elect who from Thy favor fell, <br> But not from Thine election! O forgive, <br> Speak but the word, and, lo! the dead shall live. <br> <br>4 Father of mercies! these the long astray, <br> These in soul-blindness now the faraway, <br> These are not aliens, but Thy sons of yore, <br> O, by Thy Father-hood, restore, restore! <br> <br>5 Breathe on Thy Church, that it may greet the day; <br> Stir up her will to toil, and teach, and pray, <br> Till Zion-ward again salvation come, <br> And all her out-cast children are at home. <br> <br>6 Triune Jehovah, Thine the grace and power, <br> Thine all the work, its past, its future hour; <br> O Thou, who failest not, Thy gifts fulfill, <br> And crown the calling of Thy changeless will. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Concordia: a collection of hymns and spiritual songs #<br>195</p>
