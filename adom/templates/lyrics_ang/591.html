        <p><br>1. Thou, the Christ forever one, <br> Marys child and Israels God, <br> Daniels prince and Davids son, <br> Jacobs star and Jesses rod, <br> Thou of whom of the prophets spake, <br> Thou in whom their words came true, <br> Hear the pleading prayer we make, <br> Hear the Gentile for the Jew! <br> <br>2. Knowing what the Spirit saith, <br> Sure of Thee, our Christ divine, <br> Lo, we stand, by right of faith, <br> Heirs of Abrahams chartered line; <br> Can we then his sons forget, <br> Branches severed from their tree, <br> Exiles from their homes, and yet <br> Kinsmen, Lord, in flesh to Thee? <br> <br>3. Though the blood betrayed and spilt, <br> On the race entailed a doom, <br> Let its virtue cleanse the guilt, <br> Melt the hardness, chase the gloom; <br> Lift the veil from off their heart, <br> Make them Israelites indeed, <br> Meet once more for lot and part <br> With Thy households genuine seed. <br> <br>4. Thou that didst Thy dews outpour, <br> Crowning alien grafts with fruit, <br> Soon the native growths restore, <br> Making glad the parent root: <br> Ah! but let not pride ensnare <br> Souls that need to mourn their sin; <br> Still the boughs adopted spare, <br> And the outcastsgraft them in! <br> <br>5. Speed the day of union sweet <br> When with us in faith allied, <br> Israels heart shall turn to greet <br> Thee, whom Israel crucified; <br> Thee, in all Thy truth and grace, <br> Owned at last as Salems king, <br> While her children find their place, <br> Gathered safe beneath Thy wing. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>6948</p>
