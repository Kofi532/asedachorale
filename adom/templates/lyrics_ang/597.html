        <p><br>1. As near the wished for port we draw <br> We lift our hearts in praise to Thee, <br> Almighty Father, loving Lord, <br> Our Pilot on the troubled sea. <br> <br>2. By Thy good care in peace we come, <br> From fire and foe securely kept, <br> And after tempest, at Thy word, <br> The waves have laid them down and slept. <br> <br>3. As Thou hast givn us outward calm, <br> So, Lord, within us may there be <br> A peace divine, a peace in Him, <br> Through whom alone we live to Thee. <br> <br>4. Give us more light, direct our course, <br> Cleanse us from guile, our hearts renew; <br> Let not dark clouds of sin shut out <br> The star of Jesus from our view. <br> <br>5. And then, our long life voyage oer, <br> And past the perils of the sea, <br> Receive us on the blissful shore, <br> To everlasting rest with Thee. <br> <br>6. To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, <br> The God whom Heavn and earth adore, <br> Be glory as it was of old, <br> Is now, and shall be evermore. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>200</p>
