        <p><br>1. O Jerusalem the blissful, <br> home of gladness yet untold, <br> Thou whose countless throngs triumphal <br> fill with joy thy street of gold <br> Graven on thee, new and glorious, <br> they the Kings own name behold! <br> <br>2. Many are thy sons, O mother, <br> yon august and shining band! <br> Gentle peace in all thy borders <br> makes thee glad, O happy land! <br> Perfect is thy restoration, <br> bright in holiness to stand. <br> <br>3. Here, a figure of the heavenly, <br> shines our temple, worthier grown <br> By its richer restoration <br> on the old foundation stone. <br> With a majesty and beauty <br> to the former house unknown. <br> <br>4. Lord, we pray Thee, Master Builder, <br> great and holy, enter in, <br> Fill Thy sanctuary quickly, <br> as our hallowing rites begin, <br> And Thyself its consecrator <br> rest for evermore therein. <br> <br>5. Make Thy servants, though unworthy, <br> temples of Thy grace to be; <br> Let us not in flesh or spirit <br> prove disloyal unto Thee, <br> But in dedicated service <br> praise Thy name adoringly. <br> <br>6. Make, O royal Priest, Thine altar <br> here henceforth a throne of light, <br> Ever held in highest honor, <br> and with many a gift made bright, <br> Ever blessèd, ever peaceful, <br> ever precious in Thy sight. <br> <br>7. Yea, our hearts, for these Thou judgest, <br> as Thy cleansèd altars bless, <br> By Thy Spirits grace renew us <br> unto perfect holiness, <br> And the sevenfold gifts from Heaven <br> grant us ever to possess. <br> <br>8. Now to Thee, through endless ages, <br> O most holy Trinity, <br> Highest honor, power unmeasured, <br> everlasting glory be; <br> God for ever and for ever, <br> Three in One, and One in Three. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>5006</p>
