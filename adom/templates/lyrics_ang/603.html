        <p><br>1 Round the sacred city gather <br> Egypt, Edom, Babylon; <br> all the warring hosts of error, <br> sworn against her, move as one: <br> vain the leaguer! Her foundations <br> are upon the holy hills, <br> and the love of the Eternal <br> all her stately temple fills. <br> <br>2 Get thee, watchman, to the rampart! <br> Gird thee, warrior, with thy sword! <br> Be ye strong as ye remember <br> that amidst you is the Lord: <br> like the night mists from the valley, <br> these shall vanish one by one, <br> Egypts malice, Edoms envy, <br> and the hate of Babylon. <br> <br>3 But be true, ye sons and daughters, <br> lest the peril be within: <br> watch to prayer, lest, while ye slumber, <br> stealthy foemen enter in: <br> safe the mother and the children, <br> in their will and love be strong, <br> while their loyal hearts go singing <br> prayer and praise for battle song. <br> <br>4 Church of God! If we forget thee <br> let his blessings fail our hand, <br> when our love shall not prefer thee <br> let his love forget our land:  <br> nay! To thee shall we be steadfast, <br> though the worlds foundations shake, <br> love of thee is love for ever, <br> love of thee for Jesus sake. <br> <br>5 Church of Christ! Upon thy banner, <br> lo, his passions awful sign; <br> by that seal of His redemption <br> Thou art his, and he is thine: <br> from the depth of his atonement <br> flows thy sacramental tide: <br> from the height of his ascension <br> flows the grace which is thy guide. <br> <br>6 God the Spirit dwells within thee, <br> his society divine, <br> his the living word thou keepest, <br> his thy apostolic line. <br> Ancient prayer and song liturgic, <br> creeds that change not to the end, <br> as his gift we have received them, <br> as his charge we will defend. <br> <br>7 Alleluia, alleluia, <br> to the Father, Spirit, Son, <br> in whose will the church at warfare <br> with the church at rest is one; <br> so to thee we sing in union, <br> God in earth and heaven adored, <br> alleluia, alleluia, <br> holy, holy, holy Lord. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>343</p>
