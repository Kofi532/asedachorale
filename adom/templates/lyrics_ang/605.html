        <p><br>1 O Lord, our strength in weakness, <br> We pray to Thee for grace; <br> For pow'r to fight the battle, <br> For speed to run the race; <br> When Thy baptismal waters <br> Were poured upon our brow, <br> We then were made Thy children, <br> And pledged our earliest vow. <br> <br>2 We then were sealed and hallowed <br> By Thy life-giving Word, <br> Were made the Spirit's temples, <br> And members of the Lord; <br> With His own blood He bought us, <br> And made the purchase sure; <br> His are we: may He keep us <br> Forever chaste and pure. <br> <br>3 Conformed to His own likeness <br> May we so live and die, <br> That in the grave our bodies <br> In holy peace may lie, <br> And at the resurrection <br> Forth from those graves may spring <br> Like to the glorious body <br> Of Christ, our Lord and King. <br> <br>4 The pure in heart are bless√®d, <br> For they shall see the Lord <br> Forever and forever <br> By Seraphim adored; <br> And they shall drink the pleasures, <br> Such as no tongue can tell, <br> From heaven' crystal river, <br> And life's eternal well. <br> Amen. <br>  <br> Source: The Hymnal and Order of Service #<br>258</p>
