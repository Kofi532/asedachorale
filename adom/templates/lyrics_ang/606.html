        <p><br>1. O Father, in whose great design <br> Our human love is made divine, <br> Teach us to give our love to those <br> By sin beset and all its woes; <br> On Thee for them to cast our care, <br> By fasting and by lowly prayer. <br> <br>2. Lord Jesu, grant us eyes to see <br> In our poor brethren Thine and Thee <br> To give ourselves where others need; <br> Where others sin to intercede; <br> And thus, by fasting and by prayer, <br> Our brethrens burden seek to bear. <br> <br>3. O Spirit, by whose grace alone <br> The many members are made one <br> O warm our hearts, inspire our will, <br> That we Thy purpose may fulfill; <br> And thus, by fasting and by prayer, <br> Through Thee the glorious Church prepare. <br> <br>4. O God, all-loving Three in One <br> Whom we shall see beyond the sun; <br> Where walk in white the blood-bought throng, <br> Where soars to Thee the sweet new song, <br> Grant that we find the brethren there <br> We sought by fasting and by prayer. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>4808</p>
