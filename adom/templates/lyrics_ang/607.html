        <p><br>1 O Thou before Whose presence <br> No evil may come in, <br> Yet Who dost look in mercy <br> Down on this world of sin; <br> O give us noble purpose <br> To set the sin-bound free, <br> And Christ-like, tender pity, <br> To seek the lost for Thee. <br> <br>2 Fierce is our subtle foeman; <br> The forces at his hand <br> With woes that none can number <br> Despoil the pleasant land; <br> All they who war against them, <br> In strife so keen and long, <br> Must in their Savior's armor <br> Be stronger than the strong. <br> <br>3 So hast Thou wrought among us <br> The great things that we see; <br> For things that are we thank Thee, <br> And for the things to be; <br> For bright hope is uplifting <br> Faint hands and feeble knees, <br> To strive beneath Thy blessing <br> For greater things than these. <br> <br>4 Lead on, O love and mercy, <br> O purity and power, <br> Lead on till peace eternal <br> Shall close this battle-hour; <br> Till all who prayed and struggled <br> To set their brethren free <br> In triumph meet to praise Thee, <br> Most Holy Trinity. <br> Amen. <br>  <br> Source: The Hymnal of The Evangelical United Brethren Church #<br>410</p>
