HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1 Safely, safely gathered in, <br> Far from sorrow, far from sin, <br> No more childish griefs or fears, <br> No more sadness, no more tears; <br> For the life so young and fair <br> Now hath passed from earthly care; <br> God Himself the soul will keep, <br> Giving His beloved sleep. <br> <br>2 Safely, safely gathered in, <br> Far from sorrow, far from sin; <br> Passed beyond all grief and pain, <br> Death for thee is truest gain; <br> For our loss we may not weep, <br> Now our loved ones long to keep <br> From the home of rest and peace, <br> Where all sin and sorrow cease. <br> <br>3 Safely, safely gathered in, <br> Far from sorrow, far from sin; <br> God has saved from weary strife, <br> In its dawn, this fresh young life; <br> Now it waits for us above, <br> Resting in the Saviour's love; <br> Jesu, grant that we may meet <br> There, adoring, at Thy feet. <br> Amen. <br> The Hymnal: revised and enlarged as adopted by the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America in the year of our Lord <br>1892</p>
