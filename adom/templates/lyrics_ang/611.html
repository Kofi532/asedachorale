        <p><br>1 Hail to the Lord who comes, <br> comes to his temple gate, <br> not with his angel host, <br> not in his kingly state: <br> no shouts proclaim him nigh, <br> no crowds his coming wait.<br>2 But borne upon the throne <br> of Mary's gentle breast, <br> watched by her duteous love, <br> in her fond arms at rest; <br> thus to his Father's house <br> he comes, the heavenly guest.<br>3 There Joseph at her side <br> in reverent wonder stands; <br> and, filled with holy joy, <br> old Simeon in his hands <br> takes up the promised child, <br> the glory of all lands.<br>4 Hail to the great First-born, <br> whose ransom-price they pay, <br> the Son before all worlds, <br> the child of man to-day, <br> that he might ransom us <br> who still in bondage lay.<br>5 O Light of all the earth, <br> thy children wait for thee: <br> come to thy temples here, <br> that we, from sin set free, <br> before thy Father's face <br> may all presented be. <br>  <br> Source: Ancient and Modern: hymns and songs for refreshing worship #<br>110</p>
