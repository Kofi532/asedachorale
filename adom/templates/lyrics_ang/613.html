HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1 Praise to the heavenly Wisdom <br> Who knows the hearts of all-- <br> The saintly life's beginnings, <br> The traitor's secret fall; <br> Our own ascended Master, <br> Who heard His Church's cry, <br> Made known His guiding presence, <br> And ruled her from on high. <br> <br>2 Elect in His foreknowledge, <br> To fill the lost one's place; <br> He formed His chosen vessel <br> By hidden gifts of grace; <br> Then, by the lot's disposing <br> He lifted up the poor, <br> And set him with the Princes <br> On high for evermore. <br> <br>3 Still guide Thy Church, chief Shepherd, <br> Her losses still renew; <br> Be Thy dread keys entrusted <br> To faithful hands and true; <br> Apostles of Thy choosing <br> May all her rulers be, <br> That each with joy may render <br> His last account to Thee! <br> Amen. <br> The Hymnal: revised and enlarged as adopted by the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America in the year of our Lord <br>1892</p>
