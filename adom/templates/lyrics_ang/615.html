        <p><br>1 He sat to watch oer customs paid, <br> a man of scorned and hardening trade, <br> alike the symbol and the tool <br> of foreign masters hated rule. <br> <br>2 But grace within his breast had stirred; <br> there needed but the timely word: <br> it came, true Lord of souls, from thee, <br> that royal summons, 'Follow me.' <br> <br>3 Enough, when thou wast passing by, <br> to hear thy voice, to meet thine eye: <br> he rose, responsive to the call, <br> and left his task, his gains, his all. <br> <br>4 O wise exchange! With these to part, <br> and lay up treasure in the heart  <br> who now with crown of light doth shine <br> among the apostolic line. <br> <br>5 Come, Saviour, as in days of old; <br> pass where the world has strongest hold, <br> and faithless care and selfish greed <br> are thorns that choke the holy seed. <br> <br>6 Who keep thy gifts, O bid them claim <br> the stewards, not the owners name; <br> who yield all up for thy dear sake, <br> let them of Matthews wealth partake. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>806</p>
