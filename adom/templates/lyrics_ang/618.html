        <p><br>1. Bride of Christ, whose glorious warfare <br> Here on earth hath never rest; <br> Lift thy voice, and tell the triumphs <br> Of the holy and the blest; <br> Joyous be the day we hallow, <br> Feast of all the saints on high, <br> Earth and Heavn together blending <br> In one solemn harmony. <br> <br>2. First the blessèd virgin mother, <br> Reunited to her Son, <br> Leads the host of ransomed people, <br> Who unfading crowns have won; <br> John, the herald, Christs forerunner, <br> More than prophet, leads his throng, <br> Seer and patriarch responsive <br> Unto psalmist in their song. <br> <br>3. Lo, the twelve, majestic princes, <br> In the court of Jesus sit, <br> Calmly watching, while the conflict <br> Rages far beneath their feet; <br> Lo, the martyrs, robed in crimson, <br> Sign of life blood freely spent, <br> Finding life, because they lost it, <br> Dwell in undisturbed content. <br> <br>4. All the saintly host who witnessed <br> Good confessions for His sake <br> Priest and deacon, world renouncing, <br> Of their Masters joy partake; <br> Virgins to the Lamb devoted, <br> Following with steadfast love, <br> Bring their lilies and their roses <br> To the marriage feast above. <br> <br>5. All, their happy lot fulfilling, <br> God omnipotent proclaim; <br> Holy, holy, holy, crying, <br> Glory to His holy name! <br> So may God in mercy grant us <br> Here to serve in holiness, <br> Till He call us to the portion <br> Which His saints in light possess. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>383</p>
