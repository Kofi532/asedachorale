        <p><br>1. Who the multitudes can number <br> In the mansions of the blest, <br> He can weigh the joys eternal <br> By those ransomed ones possessed; <br> Exiled now on earth no longer, <br> They have gained the home of rest. <br> <br>2. Happily at last delivered <br> From the mournful vale of tears, <br> Sweet is now their recollection <br> Of the sad and troubled years; <br> While fulfilled in all perfection <br> Gods eternal plan appears. <br> <br>3. They behold their tempter fallen, <br> Bound in everlasting chain; <br> Praising Christ their gracious Savior, <br> All unite in joyful strain, <br> Christ the great reward and portion <br> Which adoring spirits gain. <br> <br>4. Now in shadow and in figure, <br> Mirrored in imperfect light; <br> Then, as we are known, our knowledge <br> Shall be clear, unveiled, and bright; <br> For on Gods unclouded glory <br> We shall gaze with cleansèd sight. <br> <br>5. Then the Trinity of Persons <br> We shall face to face behold, <br> And the unity of substance <br> Shall its mystery unfold; <br> As the wondrous triune Godhead <br> We adore in bliss untold. <br> <br>6. Courage, man, be strong, be faithful, <br> Whatsoeer thy burden be, <br> For unbounded are the glories <br> Which thy sorrows work for thee; <br> Soon the light of light forever <br> Shall thine eyes with rapture see. <br> <br>7. God the Father, fount of being, <br> Thee, most highest, we adore; <br> God the Son, our praise and homage <br> We present Thy throne before; <br> Glorious Paraclete, we worship, <br> And we bless Thee evermore. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>7565</p>
