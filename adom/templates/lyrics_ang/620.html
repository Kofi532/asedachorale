        <p><br>1. In royal robes of splendor, <br> Before the great Kings feet, <br> The princes of His kingdom, <br> The crowned apostles, meet; <br> To Him their songs adoring <br> With heart and tongue they bring, <br> Pure hearts and mighty voices <br> Een as the angels sing. <br> <br>2. This Order sheds its luster <br> Oer all the human race; <br> A court of righteous judgment, <br> The rock of Gospel grace; <br> Rock of His Church, for ages <br> Elected and foreknown; <br> Whose glorious master builder <br> Is head and cornerstone. <br> <br>3. These are the Nazareans, <br> Famed heralds to the world, <br> Who, preaching Christ, His banner <br> Of victory unfurled; <br> Day unto day shows knowledge; <br> Night utters speech to night; <br> So these to earths four corners <br> Their wondrous tale recite. <br> <br>4. Christs burden light they proffer, <br> His easy yoke proclaim; <br> The seed of life they scatter, <br> That all may own His name. <br> The earth brought forth and budded, <br> Whereer their ploughshare ran, <br> And fruits of increase followed <br> The faith of God made man. <br> <br>5. These are the sure foundation <br> On which the Temple stands; <br> The living stones compacting <br> That house not made with hands; <br> The gates by which man enters <br> Jerusalem the new; <br> The bond which knits together <br> The Gentile and the Jew. <br> <br>6. Let error flee before them, <br> Let truth extend her way; <br> Let dread of final judgment <br> To faith and love give way; <br> That, loosed from our offenses, <br> We then may numbered be <br> Among Thy saints in glory <br> Around the throne with Thee. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>3038</p>
