        <p><br>1 Redeemed, restored, forgiven <br> Through Jesus' precious blood, <br> Heirs of His home in heaven <br> Oh, praise our pard'ning God! <br> Praise Him in tuneful measures <br> Who gave His Son to die; <br> Praise Him whose sev'nfold treasures <br> Enrich and sanctify. <br> <br>2 Once on the dreary mountain <br> We wandered far and wide, <br> Far from the cleansing fountain, <br> Far from the pierced side. <br> But Jesus sought and found us; <br> Our many sins He bore. <br> With cords of love He bound us <br> To Him forevermore. <br> <br>3 Dear Master, Yours the glory <br> Of each recovered soul. <br> Ah, who can tell the story <br> Of love that made us whole? <br> Not ours, not ours the merit; <br> To You alone the praise! <br> Give us a thankful spirit <br> To serve You all our days. <br> <br>4 Now keep us, holy Savior, <br> In Your true love and fear, <br> And grant us by Your favor <br> The grace to persevere <br> Till, in Your new creation, <br> Our earthly troubles o'er, <br> Heirs of Your free salvation, <br> We praise You evermore. <br>  <br> Source: Worship Supplement <br>2000 #<br>779</p>
