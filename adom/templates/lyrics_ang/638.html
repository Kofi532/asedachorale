HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1. O God, to know that Thou art just <br> Gives hope and peace within; <br> We could not in a mercy trust <br> Which takes no count of sin. <br> <br>2. I fain would open to Thy sight <br> My utmost wickedness; <br> Set, Lord, in Thy most searching light <br> What I have done amiss. <br> <br>3. No stern and needless law was Thine <br> Hard to be understood <br> But plainly read in every line, <br> Holy, and just, and good. <br> <br>4. Though basely weak my fallen race, <br> And masterful my foes, <br> I had thomnipotence of grace <br> To conquer, if I chose. <br> <br>5. Well did I know the tender Heart <br> I outraged by my sin, <br> Yet with the world I would not part, <br> Nor reign my passions in. <br> <br>6. My fault it was, O Lord, most high, <br> And not my fate alone: <br> Thou canst not suffer sin, nor I <br> In any way atone. <br> <br>7. Yet theres a plea that I may trust <br> Christ died that I might live! <br> Cleanse me, my God, for Thou art just; <br> Be faithful, and forgive. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>4922</p>
