        <p>Yesterday, with exultation <br> Joined the world in celebration <br> Of her promised Saviours birth: <br> Yesterday the Angel nation <br> Poured the strains of jubilation <br> Oer the Monarch born on earth. <br> But today, oer death victorious, <br> By his faith and actions glorious, <br> By his miracles renowned, <br> Dared the Deacon Protomartyr <br> Earthly life for Heavn to barter, <br> Faithful midst the faithless found. <br> Forward, champion, in thy quarrel! <br> Certain of a certain laurel, <br> Holy Stephen, persevere! <br> Perjured witnesses confounding, <br> Satans Synagogue astounding <br> By thy doctrine true and clear. <br> Lo! in Heavn thy Witness liveth; <br> Bright and faithful proof He giveth <br> Of His Martyrs full success: <br> Thou by name a Crown impliest; <br> Meetly then in pangs thou diest <br> For the Crown of Righteousness! <br> For a crown that fadeth never, <br> Bear the torturers brief endeavour, <br> Victory waits to end the strife. <br> Death shall be thy births beginning, <br> And lifes losing be the winning <br> Of a true and better life. <br> Whom the HOLY GHOST endueth, <br> Whom celestial light imbueth, <br> Stephen penetrates the skies: <br> There GODs fullest glory viewing, <br> There his victor strength renewing, <br> For his near reward he sighs. <br> See, as Jewish foes invade thee, <br> See, how JESUS stands to aid thee: <br> Stands, to guard His champions death! <br> Cry that opened Heavn is shown thee: <br> Cry that JESUS waits to own thee: <br> Cry it with thy latest breath! <br> As the dying Martyr kneeleth, <br> For his murderers he appealeth, <br> And his prayer their pardon sealeth, <br> For their madness grieving sore; <br> Then to CHRIST he sleepeth sweetly, <br> Who His pattern kept completely, <br> And with CHRIST he reigneth meetly, <br> Martyr first-fruits, evermore! <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Hymns of the Eastern Church (<br>5th ed.) #E<br>1</p>
