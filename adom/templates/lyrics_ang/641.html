        <p><br>1. Behold, the Bridegroom draweth nigh <br> Hear ye the oft repeated cry? <br> Go forth into the midnight dim; <br> For blest are they whom He shall find <br> With ready heart and watchful mind; <br> Go forth, my soul, to Him. <br> <br>2. Behold, the Bridegroom cometh by, <br> The call is echoed from the sky: <br> Go forth, ye servants, watch and wait: <br> The slothful cannot join His train; <br> No careless ones can entrance gain; <br> Awake, my soul, tis late. <br> <br>3. The wise will plead with one accord, <br> O holy, holy, holy Lord, <br> On us Thy quickning grace bestow, <br> That none may reach the door too late, <br> When Thou shalt enter at the gate <br> And to Thy kingdom go. <br> <br>4. Behold, the Bridegroom draweth near, <br> The warning falls on every ear: <br> That night of dread shall come to all: <br> Behold, my soul, thy lamp so dim, <br> Rise, rise the smoking flax to trim; <br> Soon shalt thou hear His call. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>444</p>
