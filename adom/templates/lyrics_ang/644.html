        <p><br>1 Th'abyss of many a former sin <br> Encloses me, and bars me in: <br> Like billows my transgressions roll-- <br> Be Thou the pilot of my soul; <br> And to salvations harbor bring, <br> Thou Savior and Thou glorious King! <br> <br>2 My Fathers heritage abused, <br> Wasted by lust, by sin misused; <br> To shame and want and mis'ry brought, <br> The slave to many a fruitless thought:-- <br> I cry to Thee, who lovest men, <br> O pity and receive again! <br> <br>3 In hunger now, no more possessed <br> Of that my portion bright and blest, <br> The exile and the alien see, <br> Who yet would fain return to Thee! <br> Accept me, Lord, I seek Thy grace; <br> And let me see a Father's face! <br> <br>4 With that blest thief my prayer I make, <br> Remember for Thy mercys sake! <br> With that poor publican I cry, <br> Be merciful, O God, most high! <br> With that lost prodigal I fain, <br> Back to my home would turn again! <br> <br>5 Mourn, mourn, my soul, with earnest care, <br> And raise to Christ the contrite prayer;-- <br> Oh, Thou who freely wast made poor, <br> My sorrows and my sins to cure, <br> Me, poor of all good works, embrace, <br> Enriching with Thy boundless grace! <br>  <br> Source: Hymnal for Church and Home (<br>2nd ed.) #<br>178</p>
