        <p><br>1 Sinful, sighing to be blest, <br> Bound, and longing to be free; <br> Weary, waiting for my rest; <br> God be merciful to me. <br> <br>2 Goodness I have none to plead, <br> Sinfulness in all I see, <br> I can only bring my need; <br> God be merciful to me. <br> <br>3 Broken heart and downcast eyes <br> Dare not life themselves to Thee; <br> Yet Thou canst interpret sighs: <br> God be merciful to me. <br> <br>4 From this sinful heart of mine <br> To Thy bosom I would flee: <br> I am not my own but Thine: <br> God be merciful to me. <br> <br>5 There is One beside the throne, <br> And my only hope and plea <br> Are in Him, and Him alone: <br> God be merciful to me. <br> <br>6 He my cause will undertake, <br> My interpreter will be; <br> He's my all; and for His sake <br> God be merciful to me. <br>  <br> Source: The Church Hymnal: containing hymns approved and set forth by the general conventions of <br>1892 and <br>1916; together with hymns for the use of guilds and brotherhoods, and for special occasions (Rev. ed) #<br>341</p>
