        <p><br>1 Lord, through this holy week of our salvation, <br> which thou hast won for us who went astray, <br> in all the conflict of thy sore temptation <br> we would continue with thee day by day. <br> <br>2 We would not leave thee, though our weak endurance <br> make us unworthy here to take our part; <br> yet give us strength to trust the sweet assurance <br> that thou, O Lord, art greater than our heart. <br> <br>3 Thou didst forgive thine own who slept for sorrow, <br> thou didst have pity: O have pity now, <br> and let us watch through each sad eve and morrow <br> with thee, in holy prayer and solemn vow. <br> <br>4 Along that sacred way where thou art leading, <br> which thou didst take to save our souls from loss, <br> let us go also, till we see yhee pleading <br> in all-prevailing prayer upon thy cross. <br> <br>5 Until thou see thy bitter travails ending, <br> the world redeemed, the will of God complete, <br> and, to thy Fathers hands thy soul commending, <br> thou lay the work he gave thee at his feet. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>137</p>
