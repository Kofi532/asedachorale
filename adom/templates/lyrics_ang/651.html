        <p>Glory to God! The morn appointed breaks, <br> And earth awakes from all the woeful past; <br> For, with the morn, the Lord of Life awakes, <br> And sin and death into the grave are cast. <br> Glory to God! The cross, with all its shame, <br> Now sheds its glory o'er a ransomed world; <br> For He who bore the burden of our blame, <br> With pierced hands the foe to hell hath hurled. <br> Glory to God! Sing ransomed souls again, <br> And let your songs our glorious Victor laud, <br> Who by His might hath snapped the tyrant's chain, <br> And set us free to rise with Him to God. <br> <br>84 <br> Darkness and night, farewell! the morn is here; <br> Welcome! the light that ushers in the day; <br> Visions of joy before our sight appear, <br> And like the clouds, our sorrows melt away. <br> Great Son of God, Immortal and renowned! <br> Brighter than morn the glory on Thy brow; <br> Crowns must be won, and Thou art nobly crowned, <br> For death is dead, and sin is vanquished now. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Hymns of the Early Church: translated from Greek and Latin sources; together with translations from a later period; centos and suggestions from the Greek; and several original pieces #<br>83</p>
