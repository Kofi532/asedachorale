        <p><br>1. Almighty Father, unoriginate, <br> Whom no man hath seen ever, nor can see; <br> Who reignest blest and only potentate, <br> Light unapproachable encircling Thee: <br> Almighty Father, hallowed be Thy name; <br> Who ever art, unchangeably the same. <br> <br>2. Thou lovest us, else had we never been: <br> Before we were, in ages long ago, <br> Thy love had us and all our wants foreseen, <br> Creating us that we Thy love might know, <br> Yea, Father, Thou, in whom we live and move, <br> Hast loved us with an everlasting love. <br> <br>3. Thou madest man immortal at the first, <br> An image of Thine own eternity; <br> And when he fell from life, through sin accursed, <br> And lost his right to the life giving tree, <br> Thy love, unconquered would to him restore <br> His life ennobled and forevermore. <br> <br>4. Such was Thy love, Thou didst not even spare <br> Thy Best-beloved, but gavst Him for us all; <br> To live that human life beyond compare, <br> And dying, by His death retrieve our fall. <br> In Him Thy love unbounded we behold, <br> For, giving Him, Thou canst not aught withhold. <br> <br>5. Thou knowest what we are, how frail and blind, <br> Thou still rememberest that we are but dust: <br> Like as a father pitieth, Thou art kind, <br> Thy justice kindness, and Thy kindness just. <br> Then hear Thy childrens prayer from Heavn Thy throne; <br> Father, Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>47</p>
