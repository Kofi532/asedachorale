HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p>I. (<br>1-<br>11). <br> Lift up thyself, my soul, <br> Above this world's control! <br> Spend and be spent in holy hymns of praise: <br> Be armed with pure desire, <br> Burn with celestial fire: <br> Unto the King of gods our voice we raise: <br> To Him a crown we weave, and bring <br> A sacrifice of words, a bloodless offering. <br> II. (<br>11-<br>22). <br> <br>20 <br> Thee on the troubled deep, <br> Thee o'er the islands steep, <br> Thee through the mighty continents of land, <br> Thee in the city's throng, <br> Or mountain tops along, <br> Or when in celebrated plains I stand, <br> Thee, Thee, O blessed One, I sing, <br> Thee, Thee, O Father of the world, Eternal King! <br> III. (<br>23-<br>36). <br> Thy praise I hymn by night, <br> Thy praise at morning light, <br> Thy praise by day, Thy praise at eventide. <br> This know the hoary stars, <br> And moon with silver bars, <br> And chiefly he that doth on high preside <br> O'er all the host of heaven, the sun, <br> Who measuring time for holy souls his course doth run. <br> IV. (<br>37-<br>50). <br> <br>21 <br> Fain to thy folds I sped, <br> And to Thy bosom fled, <br> Winging my steps from Matter's wide-spread rule: <br> Now on famed mountain peak, <br> Thy face alone to seek; <br> Now on the plain I hailed thy vestibule. <br> A suppliant thus to many a shrine <br> Of sacred rites I came, and mysteries divine. <br> V. (<br>51-<br>67). <br> And now to southern land, <br> And Libya's desert strand <br> I roamed, where neither godless spirit reigns, <br> Nor teeming cities' strife <br> Calls men to busy life; <br> That so my soul, from woeful toils and pains <br> And passions' war and groans set free, <br> And all the ills of fate, might harmonize with Thee. <br> VI. (<br>68-<br>75). <br> <br>22 <br> And might, in blest relief, <br> Unshackled now from grief, <br> With lips and tongue all cleansed, and hallowed mind, <br> Repay the hymn to Thee, <br> The hymn full due from me. <br> Be Earth and Ether holily combined <br> And Air and Sea with one accord <br> Be still, and join in adoration to the Lord! <br> VII. (<br>76-<br>85). <br> Swift breath of winds, be still, <br> And whirling pool and rill, <br> And floods that are at rivers' mouths forth hurled; <br> And streams from fountain-heads <br> That rush down rocky beds: <br> And hushed be ye, deep hollows of the world; <br> While breath in holy hymns is spent, <br> And sacrifice of praise in upward strains is sent. <br> VIII. (<br>86-<br>94). <br> <br>23 <br> Down sink the serpent's trail! <br> Nor let their craft prevail! <br> Down sink the wingèd dragon underground; <br> Who loves to cloud the soul, <br> The god who doth control <br> This lower world, and idol-worship found, <br> And urgeth on the dogs of hell <br> Against God's praying people, His true Israel! <br> IX. (<br>95-<br>107). <br> O blessèd Father, Friend, <br> My soul do Thou defend. <br> From soul-devouring dogs; defend my prayer, <br> Defend my deeds, my life, <br> From their destructive strife <br> And charge Thy holy angels, that they bear <br> To Thee this offering of my mind: <br> For hymns they carry that with Thee acceptance find. <br> X. (<br>108-<br>117). <br> <br>24 <br> Now am I borne along <br> To lists of sacred song: <br> Now holy words in streams spontaneous flow: <br> A voice within me rings, <br> And toucheth my heart-strings: <br> But unto me, O Father, mercy show; <br> Forgive, O Blessèd, if I stray, <br> In theme divine, and miss the rightful ordered way. <br> XI. (<br>118-<br>125). <br> What eye can steadfast gaze, <br> When Thy dread beacons blaze? <br> What eye so wise, so strong, of mortal man, <br> That it unclosed may bear <br> Thy vivid lightning's glare? <br> E'en of the mighty ones on high none can, <br> However strong, however bold, <br> The glorious brightness of Thy Majesty behold. <br> XII. (<br>126-<br>137). <br> <br>25 <br> Now aims the mind too far, <br> And finds repelling bar, <br> Nor can it penetrate by utmost strain <br> The depths so dazzling bright, <br> Where Thou dost dwell in light: <br> So, falling back from efforts feebly vain, <br> It courts within its proper scope <br> An object known whereon to fix the eye of hope; <br> XIII. (<br>138-<br>146). <br> That for Thy hymns it might <br> Thence pluck fair flowers of light, <br> Nor leave to thankless winds an offering: <br> But render back to Thee <br> Thine own, for Thine they be; <br> For what of all things is not Thine, O King? <br> O Father of all fathers, Thou! <br> To Thine eternal Fatherhood all beings bow! <br> XIV. (<br>147-<br>157). <br> <br>26 <br> But Father Thou hadst none; <br> Thou art the self-sprung One, <br> Before all worlds the sole great Mind existing: <br> Germ of whate'er we see, <br> Spur of all things that be <br> Root of first worlds, by Thee alone subsisting: <br> Light of all light, Truth's basis sure; <br> And Wisdom's everflowing stream, and fountain pure. <br> XV. (<br>158-<br>165). <br> O Mind immutable! <br> O Light inscrutable! <br> Thine is the eye that guides the lightning fire: <br> In Thee the ages live, <br> Thou dost their limits give; <br> Who can Thy praises reach, Eternal Sire? <br> Thou art beyond the dreams of men; <br> Beyond the reach of mind, or highest angel's ken. <br> XVI. (<br>166-<br>173). <br> <br>27 <br> O'er all Thy rule is spread, <br> The living and the dead; <br> To minds that be, the parent Mind Thou art; <br> All heaven Thou dost control, <br> Thou nourishest the soul, <br> And dost to spirit energy impart; <br> The Spring Thou art whence all things flow, <br> And from eternity the Root whence all things grow. <br> XVII. (<br>174-<br>183). <br> The only One, yet all; <br> In Thee all numbers fall; <br> The only One, yet countless evermore: <br> The self-existent Mind, <br> Yet mind with law combined; <br> Mind's realm, yet all the realm of mind before: <br> Through all, yet all beyond, art Thou: <br> To Thee, the Seed of all existing things, we bow. <br> XVIII. (<br>184-<br>190). <br> <br>28 <br> Thou art the Eternal Root, <br> Thou art the spreading Shoot! <br> Or male or female Thou be called, 'tis one; <br> To mind Thou nature art, <br> And dost Thyself impart, <br> But mind enlightened ne'er can say, 'tis done; <br> But here and there a word outpours, <br> While feebly it the unfathomed depth around explores. <br> XIX. (<br>191-<br>198). <br> Thou art the Parent Tree, <br> All have their life from Thee, <br> Or stem or branch, whatever is, is Thine. <br> Thou art the Light of light, <br> The Light of day so bright, <br> The Light that shineth evermore Divine: <br> Thou art, again, the hidden Light, <br> By its own glory hidden far from mortal sight. <br> XX. (<br>199-<br>209). <br> <br>29 <br> Yet one, yet all, one Lord, <br> One only, yet forth poured, <br> Through all forth poured in holy Mystery: <br> Of Thee thus sprung the Son, <br> Wisdom, the glorious One, <br> Creator of the universe to be. <br> The Godhead severed into twain <br> By birth ineffable, unsevered doth remain. <br> XXI. (<br>210-<br>216). <br> Yet One, though Twain, though Three: <br> Mysterious Trinity! <br> For Thou art One in Three, and Three in One. <br> I sing Thee, Unity! <br> I sing Thee, Trinity! <br> The Triune King, the Father, Spirit, Son! <br> The Light divided is not spent, <br> The One pervading mind, though parted, is not rent. <br> XXII. (<br>217-<br>224). <br> <br>30 <br> Thy holy Will is done, <br> 'Tis through the Eternal Son; <br> And from the outpoured Godhead forth there springs, <br> Which cannot be exprest <br> In words, the Spirit Blest, <br> The Uncreated! we of wondrous things <br> Have spoken; but we speak not there: <br> We dare not if we could, we could not if we dare. <br> XXIII. (<br>225-<br>231). <br> Who knows the Eternal Laws? <br> Who knows the First Great Cause? <br> We may not say a Second, or a Third. <br> O Birth beyond our reach; <br> O Spring defying speech! <br> What mortal to the task himself could gird? <br> O matchless Holy One, between <br> The Father and the Son Thy Light doth intervene. <br> XXIV. (<br>232-<br>240). <br> <br>31 <br> All reverence to Thee, <br> Eternal Spirit, be! <br> Thou of the Three the middle rank dost hold. <br> And now, most glorious Son, <br> Thy praises be begun! <br> Thy birth, thy generation, is untold: <br> The Father's Son, the Father's Will, <br> With Him Thou present wast, and present Thou art still. <br> XXV. (<br>241-<br>253) <br> Thou with the Father art, <br> And ever next His heart; <br> Nor can deep flowing Time Thy birth reveal; <br> Nor aged Aeon say <br> When was Thy natal day; <br> He never learned, nor could remove the seal. <br> Son with the Father! He the same <br> Who should hereafter give to Aeon birth and name. <br> XXVI. (<br>254-<br>265). <br> <br>32 <br> Who hath adjudged the eye <br> Into God's depths to pry? <br> The subtle tongue will dare, but man is blind. <br> Such daring is in vain, <br> 'Tis godless, and profane. <br> Thou dost to Thine pour light upon the mind, <br> And guard their hearts with holy care, <br> That they in darkness sink not through gross matter's snare. <br> XXVII. (<br>266-<br>275). <br> To Thee all holy praise <br> It well befits to raise; <br> For Thou of all art Father, all are Thine: <br> Thou all the worlds didst found, <br> Thou dost all ages bound, <br> Thou framedst all the host of heaven divine; <br> To Thee all minds of light do sing, <br> And starry spheres intelligent hail thee their King! <br> XXVIII. (<br>276-<br>285). <br> <br>33 <br> While round in holy choir <br> Dance their bright orbs of fire, <br> The blest ones all do shout and sing before Thee; <br> The world within, around, <br> They all Thy praise resound, <br> All in their stations evermore adore Thee: <br> Those in the zones; and those outside, <br> Who yet their several posts assigned in wisdom guide. <br> XXIX. (<br>286-<br>300). <br> These come to guard, or tame, <br> Earth's helmsmen, sons of fame; <br> Of link angelic, and who draw their birth <br> From old heroic race; <br> Who ever take their place, <br> By hidden ways, o'er men and things of earth: <br> And though of an unyielding will, <br> To dark-rayed worldly glories ever yield they still. <br> XXX. (<br>301-<br>311). <br> <br>34 <br> To Thee blithe nature sings, <br> And all from her that springs: <br> For Thou with heavenly breath dost them renew, <br> Forth pouring from above <br> Thy stores of grace and love, <br> Which ever fresh descend in showers and dew; <br> Thou to all nature nature art, <br> O Lord of worlds unstained! and dost Thine own impart. <br> XXXI. (<br>312-<br>319). <br> For nature Thou didst train <br> And school, that she again <br> Might parent be of every mortal thing; <br> The faithful counterpart <br> Of all that Thyself art, <br> Of life and health the everflowing spring! <br> That to the world's extremest bound <br> Each part in turn with living beauty might be crowned. <br> XXXII. (<br>320-<br>328). <br> <br>35 <br> For it were never right <br> That things should jar and fight, <br> Or dregs of earth with excellence contend; <br> But all by Thy decree <br> Is wrought in harmony; <br> Nor aught shall perish, nor the chorus end; <br> But each from other takes its share, <br> And all through one another taste Thy loving care. <br> XXXIII. (<br>329-<br>334). <br> The eternal wheel revolves, <br> And the dark riddle solves; <br> Things die; Thou sendest forth Thy breath, they live, <br> And in fresh glory bloom, <br> Renewed from mortal doom. <br> Thus nurtured nature nurturing doth give; <br> And she doth sing a deathless song <br> To Thee by all her children through the ages long. <br> XXXIV. (<br>335-<br>342). <br> <br>36 <br> In colour or in skin, <br> Without, or life within, <br> And deeds, however varied they may be, <br> Yet nature moulds them all <br> Obedient to her call; <br> And links them fast in holy unity; <br> And from all creatures thus doth raise <br> Of differing voices one harmonious hymn of praise. <br> XXXV. (<br>343-<br>357). <br> To Thee, their Lord and King, <br> All things their tribute bring <br> Of ceaseless praise; the night, the morn, the sky, <br> The lightning flash, the snow, <br> And things that spring and grow; <br> All bodies and all spirits; birds that fly, <br> And beasts that graze; seeds, plants, and roots; <br> The sea with all that swims, and earth with all her fruits. <br> XXXVI. (<br>358-<br>367). <br> <br>37 <br> The waves of trouble roll; <br> Look Thou upon my soul, <br> To act so powerless, to learn so slow, <br> Where on Thy Libyan sands <br> The mystic temple stands; <br> For hither I, Thy holy will to know, <br> Oppressed with grief, my steps have bent, <br> On prayer and supplication unto Thee intent. <br> XXXVII. (<br>368-<br>374). <br> Before Thy favouring eye <br> Earth's gloomy vapours fly: <br> Look Thou on me, and bid my sorrows cease. <br> 'Tis so! e'en now my heart <br> Through food Thy hymns impart-- <br> For Thine they are--hath nourishment of peace, <br> And points my mind with keen desire <br> To rise afresh to thoughts and words of heavenly fire. <br> XXXVIII. (<br>375-<br>380). <br> <br>38 <br> But send, O King, Thy light, <br> To quicken my dull sight, <br> And guide me on the road that leads to Thee. <br> And, Father, grant, I pray, <br> That from the body's sway <br> My better part, escaping, may be free, <br> And not again be downward hurled <br> Beneath the floods and eddies of this troubled world. <br> XXXIX. (<br>381-<br>391). <br> Yet here, while in the strife <br> Of world-enchainèd life, <br> O Blessèd, may kind fortune smile on me; <br> Nor stormy tempest blow <br> To check the holy glow, <br> Or rudely break the mind's tranquillity; <br> Lest inrush of the worldly flood <br> Should leave to me no leisure for the things of God. <br> XL. (<br>392-<br>400). <br> <br>39 <br> And whereto I have striven, <br> By grace which Thou hast given, <br> (For all good gifts of help and strength are Thine), <br> May I the ground retain, <br> Nor e'er fall back again. <br> For which Thy gifts this humble wreath of mine <br> From holy fields to Thee I bring, <br> O Thou of all creations pure the Eternal King; <br> XLI. (<br>402-<br>409). <br> To Thee and to Thy Son, <br> Thine own, the only One, <br> Alone of Thee begotten, the All-wise, <br> Whom from eternity <br> Thou hadst, and hast, with Thee, <br> Though forth from Thee He came to harmonize <br> All things, and fashion, form, and guide, <br> By wisdom's breath outpoured, and over all preside. <br> XLII. (<br>410-<br>416). <br> <br>40 <br> The hoary ages wake, <br> And their due course take, <br> At his command; and of His matchless skill, <br> And workmanship divine, <br> As if by plumb and line, <br> This rugged world He mouldeth to His will, <br> Whate'er exists above the ground, <br> Or on its surface, or within its depths profound. <br> XLIII. (<br>417-<br>427). <br> And merciful and kind <br> He shines with holy mind <br> On toiling mortals; and doth bring relief; <br> For He doth loose the chain <br> Of toilsome care and pain; <br> Effects their good, and drives away their grief. <br> The God who did the world create, <br> What marvel that His own He guard from whelming fate? <br> XLIV. (<br>428-<br>440). <br> <br>41 <br> And hither southward now, <br> That I might pay this vow <br> To Thee the mighty world's eternal guide, <br> I came from northern Thrace, <br> Where three years' dreary space <br> Near the Imperial Court I did abide, <br> In toil, with tears and anguish sore, <br> For on my shoulders I my mother country bore, <br> XLV. (<br>441-<br>454). <br> And well Thou know'st, good Lord, <br> How from my limbs was poured <br> A sweat of agony from day to day: <br> Nor rest had I by night <br> In that dire mental fight: <br> But watered was the couch on which I lay <br> From streaming eyes. Then to and fro, <br> To every shrine a suppliant I made haste to go. <br> XLVI. (<br>455-<br>462). <br> <br>42 <br> To all in turn I bring <br> Prayer, chaplet, offering, <br> And water with my tears each sacred floor, <br> That I might not with pain <br> Have journey made in vain, <br> But that Thou wouldst wide-open hopeful door. <br> Thus in my own and country's need <br> I with Thy holy ones through fruitful Thrace did plead; <br> XLVII. (<br>463-<br>473). <br> And who across the main, <br> Guard Carthaginian plain, <br> I sought them all, if they might succour me, <br> Throughout the region round, <br> Whom Thou with rays hadst crowned <br> Angelic, Thine attendant saints to be. <br> The blest ones helped my eager prayers, <br> They helped my many toils, and soothed my many cares. <br> XLVIII. (<br>474-<br>489). <br> <br>43 <br> Life did no pleasure yield, <br> While my poor country reeled <br> Half stunned: but Thou hast righted her, O King! <br> The Rock of Ages Thou, <br> To whom the world doth bow! <br> Crushed were my limbs, my soul a lifeless thing: <br> But Thou from Heaven hast breathed at length <br> New vigour on my soul, and on my limbs new strength. <br> XLIX. (<br>490-<br>497). <br> For Thou hast-brought relief, <br> And stayed o'erflowing grief: <br> Toils have an end, the wearied soul hath rest. <br> 'Twas by Thy wisdom planned, <br> 'Twas wrought out by Thy hand. <br> Thou to my mind hast given refreshment blest. <br> Now, O my God, do Thou ordain, <br> That to the Libyans these Thine own sweet gifts remain; <br> L. (<br>498-<br>505). <br> <br>44 <br> Of our long tribulation, <br> Of Thy so great Salvation, <br> A lasting record! Hear Thy suppliant's prayer; <br> And henceforth may my life <br> Be safe from harmful strife. <br> Loose me from toil, disease, and deadly care. <br> Thus to Thy servant bow Thine ear, <br> And grant my mental life be ever bright and clear. <br> LI. (<br>506-<br>523). <br> I would not showers of wealth <br> To try the soul's best health, <br> And leave no leisure for the things divine; <br> Nor poverty would I, <br> With downcast sullen eye, <br> Black spectre to the house, prone to repine, <br> Bowed down to earth with earthly cares. <br> Both grovel on the ground, and both are dangerous snares. <br> LII. (<br>524-<br>532). <br> <br>45 <br> And both forgetful are <br> Of better things by far, <br> The mind, and all that to the mind doth cling, <br> Unless, O heavenly Friend, <br> Thou shouldst Thy help extend. <br> Yea, Father, wisdom's holy self and spring, <br> Upon this faltering soul of mine <br> The light of mind from Thine own bosom cause to shine. <br> LIII. (<br>533-<br>543). <br> And on my heart, I pray, <br> Turn Thou blest wisdom's ray, <br> With helping hand, and point the holy road <br> That leadeth unto Thee; <br> And set Thy seal on me, <br> And let me have the token of my God; <br> And from my life, and from my prayer, <br> Drive earthly demons of presumption and despair. <br> LIV. (<br>544-<br>553). <br> <br>46 <br> And may my body be <br> From all dishonour free, <br> As fortress unassailable to foe; <br> And may my spirit pure <br> Unto the end endure <br> By Thine all-saving help. Full well I know, <br> That I do bear dark worldly stain, <br> And held in bondage am by earthly passions' chain; <br> LV. (<br>544-<br>563). <br> But Thou deliverer art, <br> And cleanser of the heart. <br> From evils circling round escape afford, <br> And from diseases all, <br> And bonds that fret and gall. <br> I bear Thy seed, of noble mind, good Lord, <br> A spark that issued forth from Thee, <br> And flashing down through depths of matter lit on me. <br> LVI. (<br>564-<br>574). <br> <br>47 <br> For in the world, O King, <br> Thou mad'st a soul to spring, <br> And in the body, through the soul, a mind: <br> O pity then Thine own, <br> The handmaid from Thy throne: <br> From Thee descending, hapless I did bind <br> Myself as labourer free to earth: <br> Not labourer now, but slave, downfallen from my birth. <br> LVII. (<br>575-<br>585). <br> For, me the world around <br> With witchery hath bound, <br> Some little strength may yet remain in me <br> Of secret inner light, <br> Not yet extinguished quite: <br> But o'er my head is rolled a mighty sea, <br> That doth make blind the mental eye <br> That would its God and things of heavenly worth descry. <br> LVIII. (<br>586-<br>592). <br> <br>48 <br> O look with pitying eye, <br> And hear the mournful cry <br> Of Thine own child, O Father good and kind: <br> Whom oft when she would rise <br> Up to her native skies, <br> Impelled by holy efforts of the mind, <br> Yet fascination of this world <br> Hath choked, and back to earth's dark mazes hurled. <br> LIX. (<br>593-<br>602). <br> But O! send forth Thy light, <br> A beacon fire through night, <br> To guide' and cheer me on my upward way; <br> And may that seed take root, <br> And, striking out its shoot <br> From small beginning, bead of flower display. <br> O Father, such Thy help divine, <br> Enthrone me in the light of life above to shine; <br> LX. (<br>603-<br>611). <br> <br>49 <br> Where nature cannot clasp <br> With her resistless grasp: <br> And whence no longer earth, or web of fate, <br> Can back recall to woe <br> And vain desires below. <br> Let brood deceitful that I scorn and hate <br> Of worldly passions scattered be, <br> And leave thy servant, O my God, at peace with Thee! <br> LXI. (<br>612-<br>627). <br> Me and earth's din betwixt <br> Be fiery barrier fixed. <br> Thy grace, O Father, to my soul reveal; <br> And let thy suppliant find, <br> With outspread wings of mind, <br> The ascending path, and bear aloft Thy seal, <br> A terror to the up-springing foe, <br> Who breathe to mortals godless thoughts from depths below; <br> LXII. (<br>628-<br>635). <br> <br>50 <br> But badge and token known <br> To those about Thy throne, <br> The holy ones, who all the heights survey <br> Of Thy bright world, and stand <br> As guards in high command, <br> Bearing the keys of upward fiery way, <br> That they may give an entrance free, <br> And open wide the gates of heavenly light to me. <br> LXIII. (<br>636-<br>645), <br> But still while creeping here <br> Upon this empty sphere <br> Of earth, yet not of earth grant me to be; <br> But from a better root <br> E'en here attesting fruit <br> To bear of fire-proved deeds, my God, to Thee; <br> And Thy true voice to hear and know, <br> And whate'er warms and makes in souls blest hope to grow. <br> LXIV. (<br>646-<br>653). <br> <br>51 <br> It doth me now repent <br> Of life on earth ill-spent: <br> Begone, the blear-eyed haze of godless men, <br> And built-up cities' strength <br> Begone, ye breadth and length <br> Of worldly aims, nor harass me again, <br> Ye sweet calamities, ye toys <br> Of mighty seeming, bootless boons, and joyless joys. <br> LXV. (<br>654-<br>661). <br> Tranced by your bravery <br> The soul in slavery <br> To earth is held; and wretched is indeed; <br> For of her own good things <br> This cup oblivion brings: <br> And things, wherewith to satisfy her need <br> She hoped, are forthwith snatched away; <br> And from vain dream she wakes to envy's shaft a prey. <br> LXVI. (<br>662-<br>670). <br> <br>52 <br> For fortune here below <br> A double face doth show, <br> False queen: whom if you haply win and trust, <br> And in her livery shine, <br> And at her table dine, <br> Soon rue your lot with bitter tears you must, <br> When down from pedestal so high <br> You fall in widespread ruin, and neglected lie. <br> LXVII. (<br>672-<br>683). <br> For here, from adverse sides, <br> Now good, now ill, betides: <br> To mortals such is life's necessity. <br> To God, or what hath birth <br> From God, but not to earth, <br> Is good unmingled with adversity. <br> Did cup of sweets intoxicate? <br> Ensnared I learnt by crop of woes a lesson late. <br> LXVIII. (<br>684-<br>693). <br> <br>53 <br> I hate these laws of change <br> And hence now upward range, <br> With wings expanded, to the peaceful sky: <br> To bright ethereal plains, <br> Where my dear Father reigns, <br> From earth, and earths two-sided gifts I fly. <br> O Steward of the life of mind, <br> To Thee I look; with Thee may I acceptance find. <br> LXIX. (<br>694-<br>703). <br> My soul doth hang on Thee: <br> Heed Thou Thy suppliant's plea, <br> Bound here on earth, yet struggling to ascend <br> The upward paths of mind: <br> As Thou thus far hast shined, <br> O shine yet more: light wings of succour lend <br> Snap double passions' bond, and chain <br> Of earth unloose, and let my soul her freedom gain. <br> LXX. (<br>704-<br>713). <br> <br>54 <br> For nature by these chains <br> Her treacherous power obtains, <br> And binds me down to earth a helpless prey; <br> But from the body freed, <br> And all its direful need, <br> Grant me to take swift flight to realms of day, <br> To Thine own halls and Thine own breast, <br> Whence flows the Fountain of the soul; and be at rest. <br> LXXI. (<br>714-<br>725). <br> A drop from Fountain Head <br> Poured, forth, to earth I sped, <br> An exile and a wanderer from Thee; <br> Me now, I pray, restore <br> To where I was before: <br> With light ancestral may I mingled be! <br> Tune Thou my mind with Thine own choir <br> In holiness to sing the hymns Thou dost inspire. <br> LXXII. (<br>726-<br>734). <br> <br>55 <br> Once saved from mortal plight, <br> Once mingled with the light, <br> O Father, grant I never enter more <br> Within earth's black domains <br> Of penalties and pains; <br> But while I yet am chained to this dark shore, <br> And bear life's drudgery below, <br> Bid Thou that fortune's breezes on me gently blow. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Songs and Hymns of the Earliest Greek Christian Poets #<br>3</p>
