HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1. O Father, we would thank Thee <br> For all Thy love has given, <br> Our present joy of sonship, <br> Our future joy in Heaven; <br> The life which sin had blighted <br> So wondrously restored <br> By our mysterious union <br> With Jesus Christ our Lord. <br> <br>2. Rich gifts of life and gladness <br> A new and heavnly birth, <br> Baptismal waters flowing <br> To cleanse the sons of earth; <br> The strength in which to follow <br> The steps that Jesus trod; <br> And love beyond all knowledge <br> Which calls us sons of God. <br> <br>3. O mercy all abundant <br> Bestowed on us today! <br> O hope of future glory <br> Which fadeth not away! <br> By Gods great love begotten <br> To living hope and sure, <br> May we at Christs appearing <br> Be pure as He is pure. <br> <br>4. For all Thy gifts, O Father, <br> Our hymns of praise arise <br> The love which calls us children, <br> The hope which purifies; <br> The grace by which we offer <br> A service glad and free; <br> The earnest of perfection, <br> Of fuller life with Thee. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>4830</p>
