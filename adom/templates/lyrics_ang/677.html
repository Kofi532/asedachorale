        <p><br>1 Son of God, eternal Savior, <br> source of life and truth and grace, <br> Word made flesh, whose birth among us, <br> hallows all our human race, <br> you our head, who, throned in glory, <br> for your own will ever plead: <br> fill us with your love and pity, <br> heal our wrongs and help our need. <br> <br>2 Bind us all as one together <br> in your Churchs sacred fold, <br> weak and healthy, poor and wealthy, <br> sad and joyful, young and old. <br> Is there want or pain or sorrow? <br> Make us all the burden share. <br> Are there spirits crushed and broken? <br> Teach us, Lord, to soothe their care. <br> <br>3 As you, Lord, have lived for others, <br> so may we for others live. <br> Freely have your gifts been granted; <br> freely may your servants give. <br> Yours the gold and yours the silver, <br> yours the wealth of land and sea; <br> we but stewards of your bounty <br> held in solemn trust will be. <br> <br>4 Son of God, eternal Savior, <br> source of life and truth and grace, <br> Word made flesh, whose birth among us <br> hallows all our human race, <br> by your praying, by your willing <br> that your people should be one, <br> grant, O grant our hopes fruition: <br> here on earth your will be done. <br>  <br> Source: Christian Worship: Hymnal #<br>729</p>
