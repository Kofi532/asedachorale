HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1. God is a Stronghold and a Tower, <br> A Help that never faileth, <br> A covering Shield, a Sword of power, <br> When Satans host assaileth. <br> In vain our crafty foe <br> Still strives to work us woe, <br> Still lurks and lies in wait <br> With more than earthly hate; <br> We will not faint, nor tremble. <br> <br>2. Frail sinners are we: naught remains <br> For hope or consolation, <br> Save in His strength whom God ordains <br> Our Captain of salvation. <br> Yes, Jesus Christ alone <br> The Lord of hosts we own, <br> God ere the world began, <br> The Word-made-flesh for man, <br> Still conquering, and to conquer. <br> <br>3. Though fiercely strive the hosts of ill <br> Within us, and around us, <br> With fiendish strength, and fiendish skill, <br> Yet neer may they confound us. <br> Mans night of dark despair, <br> When storm clouds fill the air, <br> In Gods triumphal hour, <br> The noonday of His power, <br> One word, and He prevaileth. <br> <br>4. Our Fathers truth abideth sure; <br> Christ, our Redeemer, liveth; <br> For us He pleads His offering pure, <br> To us His Spirit giveth. <br> Though dear ones pass away, <br> Though strength and life decay, <br> Yet loss shall be our gain, <br> For God doth still remain <br> Our All-in-all forever. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>1790</p>
