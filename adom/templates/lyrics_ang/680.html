        <p><br>1 Believing fathers oft have told <br> What things by God were done, <br> When faithful men in days of old <br> Their lifelong battle won: <br> True brothers all, of one accord, <br> We hold one faith, we serve one Lord. <br> <br>2 Amid the worldÂ’s confused noise, <br> Where we but darkly see, <br> The Christ appeals, with sweet, clear voice: <br> 'My brothers, follow me, <br> Like brothers true, of one accord, <br> To hold one faith, to serve one Lord.' <br> <br>3 His Church our shelter, he our guide, <br> Our strength his healing Cross, <br> We range ourselves upon his side, <br> Where none can suffer loss. <br> Like brothers true, of one accord, <br> We hold one faith and serve one Lord. A-men. <br> <br>4 So by thy Spirit mold us, Lord; <br> Inspire our hearts to pray; <br> Our hungry souls feed with thy Word, <br> Teach all of us to say: <br> 'True brothers all, of one accord, <br> We hold one faith, we serve one Lord.' <br> <br>5 We fain would serve thy Church e'en now, <br> With hearts from self set free, <br> Striving to make thy kingdom grow, <br> O God, so may it be, <br> That, brothers true, with one accord, <br> We hold the faith and serve the Lord! <br> Amen. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Service Book and Hymnal of the Lutheran Church in America #<br>540</p>
