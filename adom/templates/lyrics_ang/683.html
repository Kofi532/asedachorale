        <p><br>1. Who is on the Lords side? Who will serve the King? <br> Who will be His helpers, other lives to bring? <br> Who will leave the worlds side? Who will face the foe? <br> Who is on the Lords side? Who for Him will go? <br> By Thy call of mercy, by Thy grace divine, <br> We are on the Lords sideSavior, we are Thine! <br> <br>2. Not for weight of glory, nor for crown and palm, <br> Enter we the army, raise the warrior psalm; <br> But for love that claimeth lives for whom He died: <br> He whom Jesus saveth marches on His side. <br> By Thy love constraining, by Thy grace divine, <br> We are on the Lords sideSavior, we are Thine! <br> <br>3. Jesus, Thou hast bought us, not with gold or gem, <br> But with Thine own lifeblood, for Thy diadem; <br> With Thy blessing filling each who comes to Thee, <br> Thou hast made us willing, Thou hast made us free. <br> By Thy grand redemption, by Thy grace divine, <br> We are on the Lords sideSavior, we are Thine! <br> <br>4. Fierce may be the conflict, strong may be the foe, <br> But the Kings own army none can overthrow; <br> Round His standard ranging, victry is secure, <br> For His truth unchanging makes the triumph sure. <br> Joyfully enlisting, by Thy grace divine, <br> We are on the Lords sideSavior, we are Thine! <br> <br>5. Chosen to be soldiers, in an alien land, <br> Chosen, called, and faithful, for our Captains band; <br> In the service royal, let us not grow cold, <br> Let us be right loyal, noble, true and bold. <br> Master, wilt Thou keep us, by Thy grace divine, <br> Always on the Lords sideSavior, always Thine! <br>  <br> Source: <br>50 Favorites: and July <br>2013 index of supplement to Evening Light Songs #<br>50</p>
