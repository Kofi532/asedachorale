        <p><br>1. What are these that glow from afar, <br> These that lean over the golden bar, <br> Strong as the lion, pure as the dove, <br> With open arms, and hearts of love? <br> They the blessèd ones gone before, <br> They the blessèd for evermore; <br> Out of great tribulation they went <br> Home to their home of Heaven content. <br> <br>2. What are these that fly as a cloud, <br> With flashing heads and faces bowed; <br> In their mouths a victorious psalm, <br> In their hands a robe and palm? <br> Welcoming angels these that shine, <br> Your own angel, and yours, and mine; <br> Who have hedged us, both day and night <br> On the left hand and the right. <br> <br>3. Light above light, and bliss beyond bliss, <br> Whom words cannot utter, lo, who is this? <br> As a king with many crowns He stands, <br> And our names are gravn upon His hands; <br> As a priest, with God-uplifted eyes, <br> He offers for us His sacrifice; <br> As the Lamb of God, for sinners slain, <br> That we too may live, He lives again. <br> <br>4. God the Father give us grace <br> To walk in the light of Jesus face; <br> God the Son give us a part <br> In the hiding-place of Jesus heart; <br> God the Spirit so hold us up <br> That we may drink of Jesus cup; <br> God Almighty, God Three in One, <br> God Almighty, God alone. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>7132</p>
