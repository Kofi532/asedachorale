        <p><br>1. The voice says, Cry! What shall we cry? <br> All flesh is grass, and like the flower <br> Its glories droop, its pleasures die, <br> Its joys but last one fleeting hour. <br> <br>2. The voice says, Cry! O piteous cry! <br> And are there none to help and save? <br> Have all that live beneath the sky <br> No other prospect but a grave? <br> <br>3. The voice says, Cry! Yet glorious cry! <br> The Word of God can never fall, <br> And tells how Jesus, throned on high, <br> Holds out eternal life to all. <br> <br>4. The voice says, Cry! Who needs the cry? <br> O brother men! who needs it not? <br> By countless millions, far and nigh, <br> Tis still unheard, despised, forgot. <br> <br>5. The voice says, Cry! What stops the cry? <br> Our greed of wealth, our love of ease, <br> Our lack of earnest will to try <br> Mankind to save, and God to please. <br> <br>6. The voice says, Cry! O let us cry! <br> Though standing on deaths awful brink, <br> Men feast, they jest, they sell, they buy, <br> And cannot see, and will not think. <br> <br>7. The voice says, Cry! Lord, we would cry <br> But of Thy goodness teach us how; <br> For fast the hours of mercy fly, <br> And, if we cry, it must be now! <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>7083</p>
