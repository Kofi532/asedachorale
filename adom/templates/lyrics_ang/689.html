        <p><br>1 Once to every man and nation <br> Comes the moment to decide, <br> In the strife of truth with falsehood, <br> For the good or evil side; <br> Some great cause, God's new Messiah, <br> Offering each the bloom or blight, <br> And the choice goes by forever <br> Twixt that darkness and that light. <br> <br>2 Then to side with truth is noble, <br> When we share her wretched crust, <br> Ere her cause bring fame and profit, <br> And 'tis prosperous to be just; <br> Then it is the brave man chooses <br> While the coward stands aside, <br> Till the multitude make virtue <br> Of the faith they had denied. <br> <br>3 By the light of burning martyrs, <br> Christ, Thy bleeding feet we track, <br> Toiling up new Calvaries ever <br> With the cross that turns not back; <br> New occasions teach new duties, <br> Time makes ancient good uncouth; <br> They must upward still and onward, <br> Who would keep abreast of truth. <br> <br>4 Though the cause of evil prosper, <br> Yet 'tis truth alone is strong; <br> Though her portion be the scaffold, <br> And upon the throne be wrong: <br> Yet that scaffold sways the future, <br> And, behind the dim unknown, <br> Standeth God within the shadow <br> Keeping watch above His own. <br>  <br> Source: African Methodist Episcopal Church Hymnal #<br>432</p>
