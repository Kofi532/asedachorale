HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1 Glory to Thee, O Lord, <br> Who, from this world of sin, <br> By cruel Herod's ruthless sword <br> Those precious ones didst win. <br> <br>2 Glory to Thee for all <br> The ransom'd infant band, <br> Who since that hour have heard Thy call, <br> And reached the quiet land. <br> <br>3 O that our hearts within, <br> Like theirs, were pure and bright; <br> O that, as free from deeds of sin <br> We shrank not from Thy sight. <br> <br>4 Lord, help us every hour <br> Thy cleansing grace to claim; <br> In life to glorify Thy power, <br> In death to praise Thy Name. <br> Hymnal: according to the use of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America, <br>1871</p>
