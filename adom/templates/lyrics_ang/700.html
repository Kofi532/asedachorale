        <p><br>1 Give light, O Lord, that we may learn <br> the way that leads to thee, <br> that where our hearts true joy discern, <br> our life may be. <br> <br>2 Give light, O Lord, that we may know <br> thy one unchanging truth, <br> and follow, all our days below, <br> our Guide in youth. <br> <br>3 Give light, O Lord, that we may see <br> where wisdom bids beware, <br> and turn our doubting minds to thee, <br> in faithful prayer. <br> <br>4 Give light, O Lord, that we may look <br> beneath, around, above, <br> and learn from natures living book <br> thy power and love. <br> <br>5 Give light, O Lord, that we may read <br> all signs that thou art near, <br> and, while we live, in word and deed <br> thy name revere. <br> <br>6 Give light, O Lord, that we may trace <br> in trial, pain, and loss <br> in poorest lot, and lowest place, <br> a Saviours cross. <br> <br>7 Give light, O Lord, that we may see <br> a home beyond the sky, <br> where all who live in Christ with thee <br> shall never die. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>395</p>
