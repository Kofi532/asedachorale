        <p><br>1 God of our fathers, unto Thee <br> Our fathers cried in danger's hour, <br> And then Thou gavest them to see <br> The acts of Thine Almighty power. <br> They cried to Thee, and Thou didst hear; <br> They called on Thee and Thou didst save; <br> And we, their sons, today draw near <br> Thy Name to praise, Thy help to crave <br> Refrain: <br> Lord God of Hosts, uplift Thine hand, <br> Protect and bless our Fatherland. <br> <br>2 Thine is the Majesty, O Lord, <br> And Thine dominion over all; <br> When Thou commandest, at Thy word <br> Great kings and nations rise or fall. <br> For eastern realms, for western coasts, <br> For islands wash'd by many a sea, <br> The praise be given, O God of Hosts, <br> Not unto us but unto Thee. [Refrain] <br> <br>3 If in Thy grace Thou should'st allow <br> Our fame to wax thro' coming days, <br> Still grant us humbly, then as now, <br> Thy help to crave, Thy Name to praise. <br> Not all alike in speech or birth, <br> Alike we bow before Thy throne; <br> Our fatherland throughout the earth <br> Our Father's noble acts we own. [Refrain] <br>  <br> Source: The Church Hymnal: containing hymns approved and set forth by the general conventions of <br>1892 and <br>1916; together with hymns for the use of guilds and brotherhoods, and for special occasions (Rev. ed) #<br>573</p>
