        <p><br>1. Praise to our God, whose bounteous hand <br> Prepared of old our glorious land; <br> A garden fenced with silver sea; <br> A people prosperous, strong, and free. <br> <br>2. Praise to our God; through all our past <br> His mighty arm hath held us fast; <br> Till wars and perils, toils and tears, <br> Have brought the rich and peaceful years. <br> <br>3. Praise to our God; the vine He set <br> Within our coasts is fruitful yet; <br> On many a shore her offshoots grow; <br> Neath many a sun her clusters glow. <br> <br>4. Praise to our God; His power alone <br> Can keep unmoved our ancient throne, <br> Sustained by counsels wise and just, <br> And guarded by a peoples trust. <br> <br>5. Praise to our God, who still forbears, <br> Who still this sinful nation spares, <br> Who calls us still to seek His face, <br> And lengthens out our day of grace. <br> <br>6. Praise to our God; through chastenings stern <br> Our evil dross should thoroughly burn, <br> His rod and staff, from age to age, <br> Shall rule and guide His heritage! <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>5695</p>
