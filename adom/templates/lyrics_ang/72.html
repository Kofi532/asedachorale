        <p><br>1 The year is gone, beyond recall, <br> with all its hopes and fears, <br> with all its bright and gladdening smiles, <br> with all its mourners tears; <br> <br>2 thy thankful people praise thee, Lord, <br> for countless gifts received; <br> and pray for grace to keep the faith <br> which Saints of old believed. <br> <br>3 To thee we come, O gracious Lord, <br> the new-born year to bless; <br> defend our land from pestilence; <br> hive peace and plenteousness; <br> <br>4 forgive this nations many sins; <br> the growth of vice restrain; <br> and help us all with sin to strive, <br> and crowns of life to gain. <br> <br>5 From evil deeds that stain the past <br> we now desire to flee; <br> and pray that future years may all <br> be spent, good Lord, for thee. <br> <br>6 O Father, let thy watchful eye <br> still look on us in love, <br> that we may praise thee, year by year, <br> with angel-hosts above. <br> <br>7 All glory to the Father be, <br> all glory to the Son, <br> all glory, Holy Ghost, to thee, <br> while endless ages run. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>95</p>
