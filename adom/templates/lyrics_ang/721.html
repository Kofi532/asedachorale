        <p><br>1 Father, who dost thy children feed <br> with manna rainèd from above; <br> who dost the saving chalice give, <br> filled by thy hand in wondrous love: <br> we praise thee for thy mercies sent <br> to us in this great sacrament. <br> <br>2 O Word-made-flesh, whom we adore, <br> the living bread sent down from heaven, <br> whose wondrous passion here shown forth <br> is the great pledge of sin forgiven; <br> we praise thee for thy mercies sent <br> to us in this great sacrament. <br> <br>3 O Holy Spirit, who dost reign <br> these earthly elements to bless, <br> making the bread his flesh to be, <br> the wine his blood, as we confess; <br> we praise thee for thy mercies sent <br> to us in this great sacrament. <br> <br>4 Ye holy angels, who, with us, <br> around Gods altar lowly bow, <br> adoring there the Crucified, <br> whose precious death is pleaded now, <br> O praise him for his mercies sent <br> to us in this great sacrament! <br> <br>5 Ye blessèd saints, enthroned on high, <br> who once the paths of earth did tread, <br> who reached in safety Gods abode, <br> as strengthened by this living bread; <br> O praise him for his mercies sent <br> to us in this great sacrament! <br> <br>6 O Holy Father, Holy Son, <br> and Holy Spirit, whom we love, <br> guide, strengthen, save us here below, <br> and bring us to our home above, <br> to praise thee for thy mercies sent <br> to us in this great sacrament! <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>587</p>
