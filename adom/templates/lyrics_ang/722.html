        <p><br>1 We hail thee now, O Jesus: <br> thy presence here we own, <br> though sight and touch have failed us, <br> and faith perceives alone. <br> Thy love has veiled thy glory <br> and hid thy power divine, <br> in mercy to our weakness, <br> beneath an earthly sign. <br> <br>2 We hail thee now, O Jesus: <br> in silence hast thou come, <br> for all the hosts of heaven <br> with wonderment are dumb -- <br> so great the condescension, <br> so marvellous the love, <br> which for our sakes, O Saviour, <br> have drawn thee from above. <br> <br>3 We hail thee now, O Jesus: <br> for law and type have ceased, <br> and thou in each communion <br> art sacrifice and priest. <br> We make this great memorial <br> in union, Lord, with thee, <br> and plead thy death and passion <br> to cleanse and set us free. <br> <br>4 We hail thee now, O Jesus: <br> for death is ever near, <br> and in thy presence only <br> its terrors disappear. <br> Dwell with us, sweetest Saviour, <br> and guide us through the night, <br> till shadows end in glory. <br> and faith be lost in sight. <br>  <br> Source: Common Praise (<br>1998) #<br>80</p>
