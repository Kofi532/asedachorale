HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1 Again the morn of gladness, <br> The morn of light is here; <br> And earth itself looks fairer, <br> And heav'n itself more near; <br> The bells, like angel voices, <br> Speak peace to ev'ry breast. <br> And all the land lies quiet <br> To keep the day of rest. <br> Refrain: <br> Glory be to Jesus! <br> Let all His children say; <br> He rose again, He rose again, <br> On this glad day. <br> <br>2 Again, O lovely Saviour, <br> The children of Thy grace <br> Prepare themselves to seek Thee <br> Within Thy chosen place. <br> Our song shall rise to greet Thee, <br> If Thou our hearts will raise; <br> If Thou our lips wilt open <br> Our mouth shall show Thy praise. [Refrain] <br> <br>3 The shining choir of angels <br> That rest not day or night, <br> The crowned and palm-decked martyrs, <br> The saints arrayed in white, <br> The happy lambs of Jesus <br> In pastures fair above <br> These all adore and praise Him, <br> Whom we too praise and love. [Refrain] <br> <br>4 The Church on earth rejoices <br> To join with these to-day; <br> In every tongue and nation <br> She calls her sons to pray; <br> Across the northern snow-fields, <br> Beneath the Indian palms, <br> She makes the same pure offering, <br> And sings the same sweet psalms. [Refrain] <br> <br>5 Tell out, sweet bells, His praises! <br> Sing, children, sing His Name! <br> Still louder and still farther <br> His mighty deeds proclaim, <br> Till all whom He redeemed <br> Shall own Him Lord and King, <br> Till every knee shall worship, <br> And every tongue shall sing. [Refrain] <br>  <br> Source: The Church Hymnal: containing hymns approved and set forth by the general conventions of <br>1892 and <br>1916; together with hymns for the use of guilds and brotherhoods, and for special occasions (Rev. ed) #<br>617</p>
