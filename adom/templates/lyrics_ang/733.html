        <p><br>1 Once pledged by the cross, as children of God, <br> to tread in the steps your captain has trod, <br> now, sealed by the spirit of wisdom and might, <br> go forward, Christs soldiers, go forward and fight! <br> <br>2 Your weapons of war are sent from above: <br> the Spirits good sword, the breastplate of love; <br> your feet with the Gospel of peace be well shod; <br> put on the whole armour, the armour of God. <br> <br>3 Full well do ye know the foe must be met <br> full well do ye feel that Satan has set <br> his powers of darkness in battle array; <br> but those who are for you are stronger than they. <br> <br>4 The fight may be long, but triumph is sure, <br> and rest comes at last to those who endure: <br> the rest that remaineth, the victory won, <br> and (dearer than all things) your Captains 'Well done!' <br> <br>5 Then, on to the fight gainst sin and the world! <br> stand fast in his strength, his banner unfurled; <br> and, sealed by the Spirit of wisdom and might, <br> go forward, Christs soldiers, go forward and fight! <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>673</p>
