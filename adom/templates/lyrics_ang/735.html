        <p><br>1 God is working this purpose out, <br> as year succeeds to year; <br> God is working this purpose out, <br> and the time is drawing near; <br> nearer and nearer draws the time, <br> the time that shall surely be: <br> when the earth shall be filled with the glory of God <br> as the waters cover the sea. <br> <br>2 From utmost east to utmost west, <br> where human feet have trod, <br> by the mouth of many messengers <br> goes forth the voice of God: <br> Give ear to me, ye continents, <br> ye isles, give ear to me, <br> that the earth may be filled with the glory of God <br> as the waters cover the sea. <br> <br>3 Let us go forth in the strength of God, <br> with the banner of Christ unfurled, <br> that the light of the glorious gospel of truth <br> may shine throughout the world. <br> Let us all fight with sorrow and sin <br> to set the captives free, <br> that the earth may be filled with the glory of God <br> as the waters cover the sea. <br> <br>4 All we can do is nothing worth <br> unless God blesses the deed. <br> Vainly we hope for the harvest-tide <br> till God gives life to the seed. <br> Yet nearer and nearer draws the time, <br> the time that shall surely be, <br> when the earth shall be filled with the glory of God <br> as the waters cover the sea. <br>  <br> Source: Voices Together #<br>770</p>
