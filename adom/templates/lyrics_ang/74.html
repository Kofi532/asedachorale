        <p><br>1 Father, let me dedicate <br> all this year to thee, <br> in whatever worldly state <br> thou wilt have me be: <br> not from sorrow, pain or care <br> freedom dare I claim; <br> this alone shall be my prayer: <br> glorify thy name. <br> <br>2 Can a child presume to choose <br> where or how to live? <br> Can a father's love refuse <br> all the best to give? <br> More thou givest every day <br> than the best can claim, <br> not withholdest aught that may <br> glorify your name. <br> <br>3 If in mercy you prolong <br> Joys that now are mine, <br> If on life serene and fair <br> Brighter rays may shine, <br> Let my glad heart, while it sings, <br> You in all proclaim <br> and, whate'er the future brings, <br> glorify thy name. <br> <br>4 If thou callest to the cross, <br> and its shadow come, <br> turning all my gain to loss, <br> shrouding heart and home; <br> let me think how thy dear Son <br> to his glory came, <br> and in deepest woe pray on, <br> 'glorify thy name.' <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>94</p>
