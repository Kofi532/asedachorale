        <p><br>1 God be with you till we meet again; <br> loving counsels guide, uphold you, <br> may the Shepherds care enfold you; <br> God be with you till we meet again. <br> Refrain: <br> Till we meet, till we meet, <br> till we meet at Jesus feet. <br> Till we meet, till we meet, <br> God be with you till we meet again. <br> <br>2 God be with you till we meet again; <br> unseen wings, protecting, hide you, <br> daily manna still provide you; <br> God be with you till we meet again. [Refrain] <br> <br>3 God be with you till we meet again; <br> when lifes perils thick confound you, <br> put unfailing arms around you; <br> God be with you till we meet again. [Refrain] <br> <br>4 God be with you till we meet again; <br> keep loves banner floating oer you, <br> smite deaths threatning wave before you; <br> God be with you till we meet again.
