        <p><br>1. Lord, while afar our brothers fight, <br> Thy Church united lifts her prayer; <br> Be Thou their Shield by day and night; <br> Guide, guard, and help them everywhere: <br> O God of battles, hear our cry, <br> And in their danger be Thou nigh. <br> <br>2. For those who, wounded in the fray, <br> Are lingÂ’ring still on beds of pain, <br> Who to their loved ones far away <br> May nevermore return again, <br> O God of pity, hear our cry, <br> And in their anguish be Thou nigh. <br> <br>3. For wives and mothers sore distressed, <br> For all who wait in silent fear, <br> For homes bereaved which gave their best, <br> For hearts now desolate and drear, <br> O God of comfort, hear our cry, <br> And in the darkest hour draw nigh. <br> <br>4. Spare us, good Lord! If just the strife, <br> Yet still from guilt we are not free; <br> Forgive our blind and careless life, <br> Our oft forgetfulness of Thee. <br> O God of mercy, hear our cry, <br> And to our contrite souls draw nigh. <br> <br>5. We bow beneath the chastening rod, <br> To us the sin and shame belong, <br> But Thou art righteous, Thou art God, <br> And right shall triumph over wrong. <br> In Thee we trust, to Thee we cry; <br> Lord, now and ever be Thou nigh. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>4089</p>
