        <p><br>1 In our day of thanksgiving one psalm let us offer <br> for the saints who before us have found their reward; <br> when the shadow of death fell upon them, we sorrowed, <br> but now we rejoice that they rest in the Lord. <br> <br>2 In the morning of life, and at noon, and at evening, <br> he called them away from our worship below, <br> but not till his love, at the font and the altar, <br> had clothed them with grace for the way they should go. <br> <br>3 These stones that have echoed their praises are holy, <br> and dear is the ground where their feet have once trod; <br> yet here they confessed they were strangers and pilgrims, <br> and still they were seeking the city of God. <br> <br>4 Sing praise, then, for all who here sought and here found him, <br> whose journey is ended, whose perils are past; <br> they believed in the light; and its glory is round them, <br> where the clouds of earthÂ’s sorrows are lifted at last. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Christian Worship: Hymnal #<br>891</p>
