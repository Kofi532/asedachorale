        <p><br>1 O Lord, to whom the spirits live <br> of all the faithful passed away, <br> unto their path that brightness give <br> which shineth to the perfect day. <br> Refrain: <br> O Lamb of God, Redeemer blest, <br> Grant them eternal light and rest. <br> <br>2 Bless thou the dead which die in thee; <br> as thou hast given them release, <br> so quicken them thy face to see, <br> and give them everlasting peace. [Refrain] <br> <br>3 In thy green, pleasant pastures feed <br> the sheep which thou hast summoned hence; <br> and by the still, cool waters lead <br> thy flock in loving providence. [Refrain] <br> <br>4 How long, O Holy Lord, how long <br> must we and they expectant wait <br> to hear the gladsome bridal song, <br> to see thee in thy royal state? [Refrain] <br> <br>5 O hearken, Saviour, to their cry, <br> O rend the heavens and come down, <br> make up the jewels speedily, <br> and set them in thy golden crown. [Refrain] <br> <br>6 Direct us with thine arm of might, <br> and bring us, perfected with them, <br> to dwell within thy city bright, <br> the heavenly Jerusalem. [Refrain] <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>694</p>
