        <p>[Substitute her for him if appropriate.] <br> <br>1. Father, who hast gathered <br> This dear child to rest, <br> Unto Thee we yield him, <br> Sure Thou knowest best. <br> <br>2. Thou, O Lord, who gavest, <br> Dost Thine own reclaim; <br> Thou, O Lord, hast taken <br> Blessèd still Thy name! <br> <br>3. Thine by right creative, <br> By redemption Thine, <br> By regeneration <br> And the holy sign. <br> <br>4. Thou who didst endow him <br> With baptismal grace, <br> Now in love hast brought him <br> To behold Thy face. <br> <br>5. Safe from all earths sorrow, <br> Safe from all its pains, <br> Now this child of Adam, <br> Paradise regains: <br> <br>6. Safe from all temptation, <br> Safe from fear of sin, <br> Through the blood of sprinkling <br> Holy, bright and clean. <br> <br>7. Lay we this dear body <br> In the earth to sleep, <br> His sweet soul commending <br> Unto Thee to keep: <br> <br>8. Looking for the dawning <br> Of that deathless day, <br> When all earthly shadows <br> Shall have fled away. <br> <br>9. Only grant us, Father, <br> Courage in our strife, <br> And with him a portion <br> In unending life. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>1673</p>
