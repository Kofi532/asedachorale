        <p><br>1. O Captain of Gods host, whose dreadful might <br> Led forth to war the armèd seraphim, <br> And from the starry height, <br> Subdued in burning light, <br> Cast down that ancient dragon dark and grim; <br> <br>2. Thine angels, Christ, we laud in solemn lays, <br> Our elder brethren of the crystal sky, <br> Who mid Thy glorys blaze <br> The ceaseless anthem raise <br> And gird Thy throne in faithful ministry. <br> <br>3. We celebrate their love, whose viewless wing <br> Hath left for us so oft their mansion high, <br> The mercies of their King <br> To mortal saints to bring, <br> Or guard the couch of slumbring infancy. <br> <br>4. But Thee, the First and Last, we glorify, <br> Who, when Thy world was sunk in death and sin, <br> Not with Thine hierarchy, <br> The armies of the sky, <br> But didst with Thine own arm the battle win; <br> <br>5. Alone didst pass the dark and dismal shore, <br> Alone didst tread the winepress, and alone, <br> All glorious in Thy gore, <br> Didst light and life restore <br> To us who lay in darkness and undone. <br> <br>6. Therefore with angels and archangels we <br> To Thy dear love our thankful chorus raise, <br> And tune our songs to Thee <br> Who art, and art to be, <br> And, endless as Thy mercies, sound Thy praise. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>4726</p>
