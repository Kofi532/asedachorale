        <p><br>1. All praise be to God, whom all things obey, <br> From angels and men for ever and aye: <br> Who sendeth on earth the powers of His throne, <br> His providence good and love to make known. <br> <br>2. His angels are they of countenance fair, <br> The arm of His strength, His hand of kind care: <br> His message of peace to us they reveal, <br> His wisdom most high they seal or unseal. <br> <br>3. By martyrs of old they stood in the flame, <br> And bade them not flinch, but call on Gods name. <br> Thro torment, thro shame, thro darkness of death <br> They led without fear the sires of our faith. <br> <br>4. They stand with the few, they fight for the free, <br> Gods reign to advance oer land and oer sea: <br> And when the brave die or fall in the fight, <br> Their spirits they bear to rest in Gods sight. <br> <br>5. For patience and toil a crown they prepare; <br> They found for the meek a kingdom full fair; <br> No famine nor plague gainst them doth prevail; <br> Their bread cannot lack, their cruse cannot fail. <br> <br>6. We pray Thee, who art Thy angels reward, <br> Thy flock to defend forget not, O Lord; <br> But prosper their aid, that us they may bring <br> To see the true face of Jesus, our King. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>208</p>
