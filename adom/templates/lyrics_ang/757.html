        <p><br>1. Our Lord the path of suffring trod <br> And since His blood for man hath flowed, <br> Tis meet that man should yield to God <br> The life he owed. <br> Alleluia, Alleluia. <br> <br>2. No shame to own the Crucified <br> Nay, tis our immortality <br> That we confess our God who died, <br> And for Him die. <br> Alleluia, Alleluia. <br> <br>3. Filled with this thought, with patient smile <br> All threats the martyr doth withstand, <br> Fights, Lord, Thy cause, and leans the while <br> Upon Thine hand. <br> Alleluia, Alleluia. <br> <br>4. Beholding his predestined crown, <br> Into deaths arms he willing goes; <br> Dying, he conquers death; oerthrown, <br> Oerthrows his foes. <br> Alleluia, Alleluia. <br> <br>5. Lord, make us Thine own soldiers true <br> Grant us brave faith, a spirit pure <br> That for Thy name, Thy cross in view, <br> We may endure. <br> Alleluia, Alleluia. <br> <br>6. Eternal Father of the Word, <br> Eternal Word, we Thee adore, <br> Eternal Spirit, God and Lord, <br> For evermore. <br> Alleluia, Alleluia. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>5150</p>
