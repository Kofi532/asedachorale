        <p><br>1. Jesu, Lord of our salvation, <br> For Thy warrior, bold and true, <br> Now accept our thankful praises, <br> And our strength do Thou renew, <br> That, like George, with courage dauntless <br> We may all our foes subdue. <br> <br>2. Blazoned on our countrys banner, <br> England bears the true knights sign: <br> Lord, our fatherland empower <br> That, endued with strength divine, <br> She may evermore with courage <br> Bear the standard that is Thine. <br> <br>3. Fill her youth with manly spirit, <br> Patient, self restrained, and pure, <br> Of Thy cause the ready champions, <br> Never flinching to endure <br> Hardness for the name of Jesus; <br> So their triumph shall be sure. <br> <br>4. Teach her manhood to confess Thee <br> As the master, Lord, and king; <br> All their powers consecrated <br> To Thy service may men bring, <br> And of loyal speech and action <br> Make to Thee an offering. <br> <br>5. Jesus, Lord, Thou mighty victor, <br> Thy all glorious name we praise; <br> Thou art with us, God Almighty; <br> Midst our ranks Thy shout we raise; <br> Where Thy kingly war cry soundeth, <br> Lead us on through all our days. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>3358</p>
