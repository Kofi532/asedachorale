        <p><br>1 Today your mercy calls us <br> to wash away our sin. <br> However great our trespass, <br> whatever we have been, <br> however long from mercy <br> our hearts have turned away, <br> your precious blood can wash us <br> and make us clean today. <br> <br>2 Today your gate is open, <br> and all who enter in <br> shall find a Father's welcome <br> and pardon for their sin. <br> The past shall be forgotten, <br> a present joy be giv'n, <br> a future grace be promised, <br> a glorious crown in heav'n. <br> <br>3 Today our Father calls us, <br> his Holy Spirit waits; <br> his blessed angels gather <br> around the heav'nly gates. <br> No question will be asked us <br> how often we have come; <br> although we oft have wandered, <br> it is our Father's home. <br> <br>4 O all-embracing Mercy, <br> O ever-open Door, <br> what should we do without you <br> when heart and eye run o'er? <br> When all things seem against us, <br> to drive us to despair, <br> we know one gate is open, <br> one ear will hear our prayer. <br>  <br> Source: Christian Worship: Hymnal #<br>916</p>
