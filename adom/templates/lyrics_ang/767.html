        <p><br>1. Righteous Father, we have wronged Thee, <br> Underfoot Thy laws have cast: <br> Now we fain would serve Thee better, <br> O forgive us what is past. <br> <br>2. Loving Jesus, we have hurt Thee, <br> Yielded to temptationÂ’s blast: <br> Now we long to stand more firmly, <br> O forgive us what is past. <br> <br>3. Holy Spirit, we have grieved Thee, <br> Sin and death have held us fast: <br> Now we yearn for life and freedom, <br> O forgive us what is past. <br> <br>4. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, <br> God eternal, first and last, <br> Penitent we kneel before Thee, <br> O forgive us all the past. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>5794</p>
