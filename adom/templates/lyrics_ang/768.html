        <p><br>1. Jesu! speak to me in love, <br> Restless, storm tossed in my sin; <br> With Thy mighty voice, O Lord, <br> Thy great calm create within; <br> Bid the stormy winds to cease, <br> Bid, O bid me go in peace. <br> <br>2. To Thee, Jesu, do I fly, <br> Wakened from my soulÂ’s dread sleep; <br> None but Thou can save me, Lord, <br> In this hour of anguish deep; <br> Thou alone canst give release, <br> Bid, O bid me go in peace. <br> <br>3. Weeping at Thy feet I fall, <br> Wearied, burdened, lonely, sad; <br> Thou dost bid me come, my Lord, <br> Thou alone canst make me glad; <br> Jesu, grant my soul release, <br> Bid, O bid me go in peace. <br> <br>4. Boldly at Thy throne of grace, <br> Lord, I now forgiveness seek; <br> In Thy tender, pitying love <br> To my soul Thy pardon speak. <br> Jesu! make my anguish cease, <br> Bid, O bid me go in peace. <br> <br>5. Prince of Peace! Who in Thy death <br> Didst for me the ransom pay, <br> Cleanse me in Thy precious blood, <br> Give to me Thy peace today. <br> Now, Lord, grant my soul release, <br> Now, Lord, bid me go in peace. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>3438</p>
