        <p><br>1 I lay my sins on Jesus, <br> the spotless Lamb of God; <br> He bears them all, and frees us <br> from the accursed load; <br> I bring my guilt to Jesus, <br> to wash my crimson stains <br> white in His blood most precious, <br> till not a spot remains. <br> <br>2 I lay my wants on Jesus; <br> all fullness dwells in Him; <br> He heals all my diseases, <br> He doth my soul redeem; <br> I lay my griefs on Jesus, <br> my burdens and my cares; <br> He from them all releases, <br> He all my sorrow shares. <br> <br>3 I rest my soul on Jesus, <br> this weary soul of mine; <br> His right hand me embraces, <br> I on His breast recline. <br> I love the Name of Jesus, <br> Immanuel, Christ, the Lord; <br> like fragrance on the breezes <br> His Name abroad is poured. <br> <br>4 I long to be like Jesus, <br> meek, loving, lowly, mild; <br> I long to be like Jesus, <br> the Father's holy Child; <br> I long to be with Jesus <br> amid the heav'nly throng, <br> to sing with saints His praises, <br> to learn the angels' song. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God #<br>209</p>
