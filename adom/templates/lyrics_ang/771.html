HYMN {{ clicked_value }}

        <p><br>1. My God! my God! and can it be <br> That I should sin so lightly now, <br> And think no more of evil thoughts <br> Than of the wind that waves the bough? <br> <br>2. I sin, and Heavn and earth go round, <br> As if no dreadful deed were done; <br> As if Thy blood had never flowed <br> To hinder sin, or to atone. <br> <br>3. I walk the earth with lightsome step, <br> Smile at the sunshine, breathe the air, <br> Do my own will, not ever heed <br> Gethsemane and Thy long prayer. <br> <br>4. Shall it be always thus, O Lord? <br> Wilt Thou not work this hour in me <br> The grace of Thy Passion merited, <br> Hatred of self, and love of Thee! <br> <br>5. O by the pains of Thy pure love, <br> Grant me the gift of holy fear; <br> And by Thy woes and bloody sweat <br> Wash Thou my guilty conscience clear! <br> <br>6. Ever when tempted, make me see, <br> Beneath the olives moon pierced shade, <br> My God, alone, outstretched, and bruised, <br> And bleeding, on the earth He made; <br> <br>7. And make me feel it was my sin, <br> As though no other sins there were, <br> That was to Him who bears the world <br> A load that He could scarcely bear. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>4221</p>
