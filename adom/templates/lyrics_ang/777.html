        <p><br>1 Who knows how near my end may be? <br> Time speeds away, and death comes on; <br> How swiftly, ah! how suddenly, <br> May death be here and life be gone! <br> My God, for Jesus sake I pray <br> Thy peace may bless my dying day. <br> <br>2 The world that smiled when morn was come <br> May change for me ere close of eve; <br> So long as earth is still my home <br> In peril of my death I live. <br> My God, for Jesus sake I pray <br> Thy peace may bless my dying day. <br> <br>3 Teach me to ponder oft my end, <br> And ere the hour of death appears, <br> To cast my soul on Christ, her Friend, <br> Nor spare repentant sighs and tears. <br> My God, for Jesus sake I pray <br> Thy peace may bless my dying day. <br> <br>4 And let me now so order all, <br> That ever ready I may be <br> To say with joy, Whateer befall, <br> Lord, do Thou as Thou wilt with me. <br> My God, for Jesus sake I pray <br> Thy peace may bless my dying day. <br> <br>5 Let heav'n to me be ever sweet, <br> And this world bitter let me find, <br> That I, 'mid all its toil and heat, <br> May keep eternity in mind. <br> My God, for Jesus' sake I pray <br> Thy peace may bless my dying day. <br> <br>6 Then death may come, or tarry yet, <br> I know in Christ I perish not, <br> He never will His own forget; <br> He gives me robes without a spot. <br> My God, for Jesus sake I pray <br> Thy peace may bless my dying day. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Hymnal and Prayer Book: compiled by the Lutheran Church Board for Army and Navy of the Ev.
