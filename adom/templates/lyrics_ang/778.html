        <p><br>1. I will go in the strength of the Lord, <br> In the path He hath marked for my feet: <br> I will follow the light of His Word, <br> Nor shrink from the dangers I meet. <br> His presence my steps shall attend: <br> His fullness my wants shall supply; <br> On Him, till my journey shall end, <br> My hope shall securely rely. <br> <br>2. I will go in the strength of the Lord, <br> To the work He appoints me to do: <br> In the joy which His smile shall afford <br> My soul shall her vigor renew. <br> His wisdom will guard me from harm, <br> His powÂ’r my sufficiency prove; <br> I will trust His omnipotent arm, <br> I will rest in His covenant love. <br> <br>3. I will go in the strength of the Lord, <br> To each conflict which faith may require, <br> His grace, as my shield and reward, <br> My courage and zeal shall inspire. <br> If He issue the word of command <br> To meet and encounter the foe, <br> Though with sling and with stone in my hand, <br> In the strength of the Lord I will go. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>3160</p>
