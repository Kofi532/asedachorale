        <p><br>1 There was joy in heaven, <br> there was joy in heaven, <br> when this goodly world to frame <br> the Lord of might and mercy came; <br> shouts of joy were heard on high, <br> and the stars sang from the sky, <br> glory to God in heaven. <br> <br>2 There was joy in heaven, <br> there was joy in heaven, <br> when the billows heaving dark, <br> sank around the stranded ark, <br> and the rainbowÂ’s watery span <br> spake of mercy, hope to man, <br> and peace with God in heaven. <br> <br>3 There was joy in heaven, <br> there was joy in heaven, <br> when of love the midnight beam <br> dawned on the towers of Bethlehem, <br> and along the echoing hill <br> angels sang, 'On earth good will, <br> and glory in the heaven!' <br> <br>4 There was joy in heaven, <br> there was joy in heaven, <br> when the soul that went astray <br> turns to Christ, the living Way, <br> and, by grace of heaven subdued, <br> breathes a prayer of gratitude; <br> oh, there is joy in heaven. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>349</p>
