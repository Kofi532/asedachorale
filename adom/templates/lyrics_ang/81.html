        <p><br>1 Songs of thankfulness and praise, <br> Jesus, Lord, to you we raise, <br> manifested by the star <br> to the Magi from afar, <br> branch of royal David's stem, <br> in your birth at Bethlehem. <br> Anthems be to you addressed, <br> God in man made manifest. <br> <br>2 Manifest at Jordan's stream, <br> Prophet, Priest, and King supreme, <br> and at Cana, wedding guest, <br> in your Godhead manifest; <br> manifest in pow'r divine, <br> changing water into wine. <br> Anthems be to you addressed, <br> God in man made manifest. <br> <br>3 Manifest in making whole <br> palsied limbs and fainting soul; <br> manifest in valiant fight, <br> quelling all the devil's might; <br> manifest in gracious will, <br> ever bringing good from ill: <br> Anthems be to you addressed, <br> God in man made manifest. <br> <br>4 Sun and moon shall darkened be, <br> stars shall fall, the heav'ns shall flee. <br> Christ will then like lightning shine; <br> all will see his glorious sign. <br> All will then the trumpet hear, <br> all will see the judge appear. <br> You by all will be confessed, <br> God in man made manifest. <br> <br>5 Grant us grace to see you, Lord, <br> mirrored in your holy Word. <br> May our lives and all we do <br> imitate and honor you <br> that we all like you may be <br> at your great epiphany <br> and may praise you, ever blest, <br> God in man made manifest. <br>  <br> Source: Christian Worship: Hymnal #<br>386</p>
