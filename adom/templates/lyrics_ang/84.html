        <p><br>1 Once more the solemn season calls <br> A holy fast to keep; <br> And now within the temple walls <br> Both priest and people weep. <br> <br>2 But vain all outward sign of grief, <br> And vain the form of prayer, <br> Unless the heart implore relief, <br> And penitence be there. <br> <br>3 We smite the breast, we weep in vain, <br> In vain in ashes mourn, <br> Unless with penitential pain <br> The smitten soul be torn. <br> <br>4 In sorrow true then let us pray <br> To our offended God, <br> From us to turn His wrath away, <br> And stay the uplifted rod. <br> <br>5 O God, our Judge and Father, deign <br> To spare the bruis√®d reed; <br> We pray for time to turn again, <br> For grace to turn indeed. <br> <br>6 Blest Three in One, to Thee we bow; <br> Vouchsafe us in Thy love <br> To gather from these fasts below <br> Immortal fruit above. <br>  <br> Source: Hymnal: according to the use of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America #<br>48</p>
