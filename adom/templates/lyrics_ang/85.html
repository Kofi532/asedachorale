        <p><br>1. By precepts taught of ages past, <br> Now let us keep again the fast, <br> Which, year by year, in order meet <br> Of forty days is made complete. <br> <br>2. The law and seers that were of old <br> In divers ways this Lent foretold, <br> Which Christ Himself, the Lord and guide <br> Of every season, sanctified. <br> <br>3. More sparing therefore let us make <br> The words we speak, the food we take, <br> Deny ourselves in mirth and sleep, <br> In stricter watch our senses keep. <br> <br>4. In prayer together let us fall, <br> And cry for mercy, one and all; <br> And weep before the Judge, and say, <br> O turn from us Thy wrath away. <br> <br>5. Thy grace have we offended sore <br> By sins, O God, which we deplore; <br> Pour down upon us from above <br> The riches of Thy pardoning love. <br> <br>6. Remember, Lord, though frail we be, <br> That yet Thine handiwork are we: <br> Nor let the honor of Thy name <br> Be by another put to shame. <br> <br>7. Forgive the ill that we have wrought, <br> Increase the good that we have sought; <br> That we at length, our wanderings oÂ’er, <br> May please Thee now and evermore. <br> <br>8. Blest Three in One, and One in Three, <br> Almighty God, we pray to Thee, <br> That Thou wouldst now vouchsafe to bless <br> Our fast with fruits of righteousness. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>712</p>
