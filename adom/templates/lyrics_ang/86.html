        <p><br>1 O thou who dost to man accord <br> his highest prize, his best reward, <br> thou hope of all our race; <br> Jesu, to thee we now draw near, <br> our earnest supplications hear, <br> who humbly seek thy face. <br> <br>2 With self-accusing voice within <br> our conscience tells of many a sin <br> in thought, and word, and deed: <br> O cleanse that conscience from all stain, <br> the penitent restore again, <br> from every burthen freed. <br> <br>3 If thou reject us, who shall give <br> our fainting spirits strength to live? <br> Tis thine alone to spare; <br> with cleansèd hearts to pray aright, <br> and find acceptance in thy sight, <br> be this our lowly prayer. <br> <br>4 Tis thou has blessed this solemn fast; <br> so may its days by us be passed <br> in self-control severe, <br> that, when our Easter morn we hail, <br> its mystic feast we may not fail <br> to keep with conscience clear. <br> <br>5 O blessèd Trinity, bestow <br> thy pardoning grace on us below, <br> and shield us evermore; <br> until, within thy courts above, <br> we see thy face, and sing thy love, <br> and with thy saints adore. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>122</p>
