        <p><br>1 Christian, dost thou see them <br> on the holy ground, <br> how the troops of Midian <br> prowl and prowl around? <br> Christian, up and smite them, <br> counting gain but loss: <br> smite them by the merit <br> of the holy cross. <br> <br>2 Christian, dost thou feel them, <br> how they work within, <br> striving, tempting, luring, <br> goading into sin? <br> Christian, never tremble; <br> never be down-cast; <br> smite them by the virtue <br> of the Lenten fast. <br> <br>3 Christian, dost thou hear them, <br> how they speak thee fair? <br> 'Always fast and vigil? <br> Always watch and prayer?' <br> Christian, answer boldly, <br> 'While I breath, I pray:' <br> peace shall follow battle, <br> night shall end in day. <br> <br>4 'Well I know thy trouble, <br> O my servant true; <br> thou art very weary, <br> I was weary too; <br> but that toil shall make thee <br> some day all mine own, <br> and the end of sorrow <br> shall be near my throne.' <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>112</p>
