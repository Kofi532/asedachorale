        <p><br>1 O Christ, who art the light and day, <br> Thou drivest night and gloom away; <br> O Light of Light, whose Word doth show <br> The light of heav'n to us below. <br> <br>2 All-holy Lord, in humble prayer <br> We ask tonight Thy watchful care. <br> O grant us calm repose in Thee, <br> A quiet night, from perils free. <br> <br>3 Our sleep be pure from sinful stain; <br> Let not the tempter vantage gain <br> Or our unguarded flesh surprise <br> And make us guilty in Thine eyes. <br> <br>4 Asleep though wearied eyes may be, <br> Still keep the heart awake to Thee; <br> Let Thy right hand outstretched above <br> Guard those who serve the Lord they love. A-men. <br> <br>5 Behold, O God, our shield, and quell <br> The crafts and subtleties of hell; <br> Direct Thy servants in all good, <br> Who Thou hast purchased with Thy blood. <br> <br>6 O Lord, remember us who bear <br> The burden of the flesh we wear; <br> Thou who dost e'er our souls defend, <br> Be with us even to the end. <br> <br>7 All praise to God the Father be, <br> All praise, eternal Son, to Thee, <br> Whom with the Spirit we adore <br> Forever and forevermore. <br> Amen. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Lutheran Service Book #<br>882</p>
