Today we celebrate Christ's birth, Today all children must rejoice, For Jesus came a child like us, Jesus was born; in flesh He came. <br/><br/>2 Jesus our loving gracious God, You came from Heav'n to dwell with us, That we may all God's nature share, And have His peace eternally. <br> <br> 3 We thank you Lord and pray to you, Come now to cleanse our hearts, [dear Lord, And live within us Lord always, That we may righteous children be. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
