Lift Jesus high, and praise His Name, For He has come to us in flesh, A Virgin womb, He came to dwell, Let this world and all angels sing. Hallelujah! <br/><br/>2 Beloved Son, the Son of God, Lay in a manger for a crib, Jesus has come, has come to save, Was born like us, with flesh and blood. Hallelujah! <br> <br> 3 Christ who is God, Almighty Lord A son of Mary in the flesh, The One who is above all things, Became a babe, a child so weak! Hallelujah! <br> <br> 4 Eternal Light of God has come, To shine in this dark world of sin, To lead us back from death to life, And make us children of the Light. Hallelujah! <br> <br> 5 Jesus laid down His life for us, To show His love for humankind, Christians come now and sing His praise, And give Him thanks, eternally. Hallelujah! <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
