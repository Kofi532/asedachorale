Jesus has come, to our world, Good news, He brings, Ancient of Days, Mighty God, Prince of Peace, Mediator Lord, God with sinners reconciled, Creator Lord, in your image made us. Good news for me and for all who are sinners, Jesus has come, joyful news He brings to all. <br/><br/>2 Jesus has come, to this world to give freedom, To break the yoke and all bondage to sin, And in Him, we are no longer slaves of sin, Freedom we have from the wages of sin. No condemnation we dread now and ever, For we have life, life in fullness in our Lord. <br> <br> 3 Jesus has come, see our glorious King Jesus, Come praise Him now all ye people on earth, O Lord of Hosts, Christ the Lord reigns eternal, He rules in hearts, Sovereign Lord, Christ the Lord. A crown of life, shall we have from the Savior, Glory we give to our Savior, Christ the Lord. <br> <br> 4 Jesus has come, spread the news to all nations, Run to and fro, raise His banner so high. Commit your heart and your life to Christ Jesus, Follow the Lord in life and unto death. Amen, Lord Jesus, you are complete in us, Jesus has come; spread the news to all around. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
