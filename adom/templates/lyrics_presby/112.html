Christ the Savior, Christ the Savior, Has been born this Day. Jesus Savior of the world, Has been born in Bethlehem; O rejoice, yes, O be happy, Men and women all! <br/><br/>2 Son of God, is born a Baby, In a manger lay; He is King of kings forever, He is Lord of all. But His kingdom here on earth, Dwells within the hearts of men; All must seek Him, all must seek Him, As the Lord and King! <br> <br> 3 Jesus Son of God, our Savior, In the flesh is born. To redeem us, to redeem all, From this sinful world; Make us all your children, Lord, King of Glory evermore; Dwell with us, our Lord Immanuel, In our hearts come dwell. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
