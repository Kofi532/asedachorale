His Kingdom He has opened now, His Son He gave for us. <br/><br/>2 Jesus, the Son of God, had come, A baby boy He came. In manger for a bed was placed, No other place was found. <br> <br> 3 His glory He left all above, Poor He became for us. Creator of the universe, Servant He came for us. <br> <br> 4 Jesus the Mighty God stooped low, Breast He used like as man. He who all angels bow before, David's son He became. <br> <br> 5 God who is Spirit, Almighty, Frail flesh and blood became. He gave His life as God for us, Children of God we are. <br> <br> 6 He opened Paradise for us, That we may enter in. Angels bid us to enter in, All praise His Holy Name <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
