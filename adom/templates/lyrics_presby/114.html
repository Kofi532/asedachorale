Praise Thy Name in my whole life, Worship and glorify. Your Name I shall always praise, Forever and ever! <br/><br/>2 Your mercy is so bountiful, Your power none can compare. And Lord you came to save me, From sin you came to save. With power redeemed from Satan, Lord you have saved my life. <br> <br> 3 I now have freedom from you Lord, My sins I bear no more. Therefore to you I yield all, Take this life that you saved. This life now belongs to you; With you to always dwell! <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
