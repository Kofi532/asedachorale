O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant, Come ye, O come ye, to Bethlehem. Come and behold Him, born the King of angels; Refrain O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord. <br/><br/>2 True God of true God, Light from Light Eternal, Lo, He shuns not the Virgin's womb; Son of the Father, begotten, not created; Refrain <br> <br> 3 See how the shepherds, summoned to His cradle, Leaving their flocks, draw nigh to gaze; We too will thither bend our joyful footsteps; Refrain <br> <br> 4 Lo! star led chieftains, Magi, Christ adoring, Offer Him incense, and gold, and myrrh; We to the Christ Child bring our hearts' oblations. Refrain <br> <br> 5 Child, for us sinners poor and in the manger, We would embrace Thee, with love and awe; Who would not love Thee, loving us so dearly? Refrain <br> <br> 6 Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, born this happy morning; Jesus, to Thee be glory given; Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing.
