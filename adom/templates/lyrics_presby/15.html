Praise the Lord, you heavens, adore Him; Praise Him, angels in the height; Sun and moon, rejoice before Him, Praise Him, all your stars of light. <br/><br/>2 Praise the Lord! for He has spoken; Worlds His mighty voice obeyed; Laws which never shall be broken For their guidance has He made. <br> <br> 3 Praise the Lord! for He is glorious; Never shall His promise fail; God has made His saints victorious; Sin and death shall not prevail. <br> <br> 4 Praise the God of our salvation! Hosts on high, His power proclaim; Heaven and earth, and all creation, Laud and magnify His name. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
