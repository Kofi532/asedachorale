For all His wondrous works in us, In Him we have all blessings. And joy eternal now we have, In Him, we have such peace in death, O magnify the Father. <br/><br/>2 The hosts of heav'n give thanks to you, King of all kings, Almighty. And we on earth join in this praise, Join to extol the Father. To praise and glorify the Lord, The One who made all things so well, O magnify the Father. <br> <br> 3 All creatures that the Lord has made, God loves, and He provides for. His eyes are upon all things made, And He sustains all creatures. God's Kingdom and His subjects too, And all things in the universe, O Magnify the Father. <br> <br> 4 In my distress to you I called, Hear all my supplications. Deliver me from death, O Lord, Save me from death by grace, Lord. So shall I praise the Lord my God, All join me in this song of praise, O Magnify the Father. <br> <br> 5 Come all before the Lord our God, Come now with joyful worship. Fulfill your vows before the Lord And give Him praise eternal. For God has done all things so well, And He deserves our praise and thanks, O Magnify the Father. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
