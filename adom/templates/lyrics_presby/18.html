All the Saints here join the throng, Give you thanks and worship you. <br> <br> 4 We here on earth join this song, Strong, weak, young and old we [come now. Praise the Lord and worship Him, Give to Him the glory due Him.

You have saved us by His life, You have made Him King forever. By your Holy Spirit, Lord We are now made Saints in you. <br> <br> 6 Gracious Father, keep us still, Jesus Christ, have mercy on us. Gracious Spirit cleanse us now, Guide us in the heav'nly way Lord. When we see you Lord in Heav'n, We shall praise you evermore. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
