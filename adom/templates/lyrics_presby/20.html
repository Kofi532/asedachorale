Come now my soul and praise the Lord Jehovah, Praise God always, till my life shall end. Come praise the Lord Jehovah, God Almighty, Let all your being praise Him always. From whom we have such a wonderful life, Come worship Him, come sing with me always, Hallelujah, Hallelujah. <br/><br/>2 Trust not in kings, for flesh they are such only, They shall return to dust as all men. Wisdom of man and plans of all men mighty, All such shall perish soon in the grave. Put not ever your trust in any man, Trust in the Lord, who is Almighty God, Hallelujah, Hallelujah. <br> <br> 3 Happy the man, whose help is God of Jacob, Who hopes in God who is Lord of all. Faithful is He, the Lord of grace and justice, Blessed is he who trusts in this God. In Him you have all wisdom and all strength, In Him alone you have all that you need, Hallelujah, Hallelujah. <br> <br> 4 Creator of the earth and of all heaven, Who made the seas and who made all things. His word shall stand forever and forever, His promises shall stand so secure. This God Almighty the all sovereign Lord, The Faithful Jehovah, the Holy God, Hallelujah, Hallelujah. <br> <br> 5 Eyes of the blind the Lord God shall soon open, Humble and meek, the Lord shall raise up. All those that trust the Lord and have faith in Him, The Lord shall always show them His love. All strangers, widows and orphans, listen, Almighty God shall provide all your needs; Hallelujah, Hallelujah. <br> <br> 6 All who forget the Lord and forsake Jesus, The Lord shall leave them to their own ways. That they may suffer for their sin and actions, The folly of their life all shall see. The Lord God is the King for evermore, Zion the Lord shall bless now and always, Hallelujah, Hallelujah. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
