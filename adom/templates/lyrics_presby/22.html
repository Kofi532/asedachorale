Praise, my soul, the King of heaven, To His feet thy tribute bring; Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven, Who like me, His praise should sing? Praise Him, praise Him, Praise Him, praise Him, Praise the everlasting King. <br/><br/>2 Praise Him for His grace and favor To our fathers in distress; Praise Him still the same for ever, Slow to chide, and swift to bless; Praise Him, praise Him, Praise Him, praise Him, Glorious in His faithfulness. <br> <br> 3 Father-like, He tends and spares us; Well our feeble frame He knows; In His hands He gently bears us, Rescues us from all our foes; Praise Him, praise Him, Praise Him, praise Him, Widely as His mercy flows. <br> <br> 4 Frail as summer's flow'r we flourish, Blows the wind and it is gone; But while mortals rise and perish, God endures unchanging on. Praise Him, praise Him, Praise Him, praise Him, Praise the High Eternal One. <br> <br> 5 Angels, help us to adore Him; Ye behold Him face to face; Sun and moon, bow down before Him, Dwellers all in time and space. Praise Him, praise Him, Praise Him, praise Him, Praise with us the God of grace. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
