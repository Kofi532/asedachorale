For His love is ever sure, Bountiful His mercies are. <br/><br/>2 Soul and spirit, life and all, These we have as gift from God. Gracious mercies from the Lord, We receive from Him always. <br> <br> 3 He gives bread the body needs, He provides the soul its needs. But sin has ruined all our lives, And we are all faced with death. <br> <br> 4 But we have a Savior now, Savior of the world from sin; Jesus Christ who died for all, Redeeming God's chosen ones. <br> <br> 5 His Word and His baptism, Have become the Food we need; Holy Spirit God gives us, By faith in God we are blessed. <br> <br> 6 Forgiveness of sin we have, And eternal life in Christ, All the promises of God, Great thing we shall have in Heav'n. <br> <br> 7 Consecrate us in the Truth, Grant us freedom from above. Lord we seek your glory now; In the Name of Christ, Amen <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
