Come praise the Lord, sing Hallelujah, Come praise Jehovah in the heav'n. All angels and God's hosts in heaven, Come with your praise and worship God. Come sun and moon, and sing your praises, Join in the praise, you stars of heav'n. Praise Him, the highest heav'n, sing praises, You waters above, praise His Name. <br/><br/>2 All creatures come to praise Christ Jesus, For at His Word, all things were made. He is the way that leads to heaven, The Way and Truth, none shall be lost. Then come all creatures that are on earth, Join in the praise and laud His Name. That all below and all in Heaven, Unite to praise the Lord Most High. <br> <br> 3 Let fire and snow, and hail and the frost, Come bring their praise to Christ our Lord. Come stormy winds, all hills [and mountains, Come fruit trees and all cedar trees. Come creeping things, come birds in [the skies, Come kings on earth and princes all, Young men and maidens, children, aged, Come praise the Lord who made all things. <br> <br> 4 Let all things praise the Lord Jehovah, His Name, alone, is exalted. His glory is above the heavens, He raised a horn for those He loves. He causes praise for all His saints here, He causes praise for His chosen. Let all those who are near to Jesus, Come shouting praise to God on High. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
