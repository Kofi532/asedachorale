When we see the glorious splendor, Of this earth and of its stores; We are pleased with wondrous beauty, Beauty in what God has made. <br/><br/>2 But this earth and all its glories, Are all nothing in God's sight Earth is but a tiny part of, All, the universe God made. <br> <br> 3 See the sun and all its beauty, Moon and stars He made them all, For our needs and for His glory, Therefore have delight in God. <br> <br> 4 But the beauty of the Lord God, Glorious is and majestic. Far exceeds all beauty in life, Beauty of this world, exceeds. <br> <br> 5 Heart of God the Lord creator, That is full of gracious love. O how glorious God Himself is, Beauty of His face we'll see. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
