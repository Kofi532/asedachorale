You dwell in all and fill all life, Eternal Lord Thou art. <br> <br> 4 All things so wondrously you made, All things you made and blessed. Your glory and your majesty, Exceed all beauty seen. <br> <br> 5 Merciful, gracious, loving God, To you, O Lord I come. I come with praises in my heart, I praise and worship you. <br> <br> 6 Ancient of Days, the Wondrous God, We are before Thy Throne.
