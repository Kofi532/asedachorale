He is our Father, God in heav'n, We are His children now by grace. The God who saves us from all sin, And sanctifies our soul and being, He is the Lord in all for all. <br/><br/>2 Our faith is in Christ, Son of God, In Jesus Christ, we all believe. He is with God the Lord of Host, And always with the Mighty God! He was conceived by Holy Ghost, Born of the Virgin Mary blessed, Flesh He became, like humankind. <br> <br> 3 He suffered much here on this earth, Was crucified and died at last. Jesus was buried in a tomb, His soul descended into hell. But on the third day He arose, And He ascended into heav'n, From there, He shall come back again. <br> <br> 4 In God the Holy Spirit, Lord, We all believe and confess now. He is the God the Comforter, In Him, we have all gifts from God. The Holy Cath'lic Church we are, Forgiven, we shall rise again, Eternal life we all shall have. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
