Glory be to God the Father, Glory be to God the Son, Glory be to God the Spirit, Great Jehovah, Three in One! Glory, glory, glory, glory, While eternal ages run! <br/><br/>2 Glory be to Him Who loved us, Washed us from each spot and stain! Glory be to Him Who bought us, Made us kings with Him to reign! Glory, glory, glory, glory, To the Lamb that once was slain! <br> <br> 3 Glory to the King of angels, Glory to the church's King, Glory to the King of nations! Heav'n and earth, your praises bring; Glory, glory, glory, glory, To the King of glory bring! <br> <br> 4 Glory, blessing, praise eternal! Thus the choir of angels sings; â€œHonor, riches, power, dominion!â€ Thus its praise creation brings; Glory, glory, glory, glory, Glory to the King of kings! <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
