His gracious mercies love profound, He pours upon His children now. God's favor is upon His own, Peace from Him now and evermore. God has reconciled man with Him. <br/><br/>2 We give to God His glory due, We give Him praise we thank Him now. Forever and forever more, You are the God, the Lord of all. Almighty God, the sovereign Lord, To whom all creatures shall repair, A safe abode in you we have. <br> <br> 3 Jesus the Lord the Son of God, Eternal One, you are the Lord. Redeemer of the world from sin Your precious Blood was shed for us. The Lamb of God was slain for us, The Lord our God, our Savior dear, Have mercy on us all, we plead. <br> <br> 4 Descend O Spirit, come to us, Dwell in our hearts, come comfort us. Bring us together, Holy One, Shine in our hearts the light of God. Destroy all evil work in us, Deliver us from all our foes, We praise you Lord forever more. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
