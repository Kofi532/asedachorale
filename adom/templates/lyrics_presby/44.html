Come to Him, all you God's chosen, Come and praise His Holy Name. For this God is fearful also, And His wrath no one can stand. But He shows His love for all men, Therefore, glorify His Name. <br/><br/>2 God revealed His Love in Jesus, In Jesus we see God's love. None can fathom this love in Christ, None can understand such love. None but God the Holy Spirit, God the Spirit now has come. He will teach us all things of God, He will help us in our faith. <br> <br> 3 Wide and high and big is His love, Love beyond the universe. Steadfast love that is enduring, Love, O Love, abiding love. Love that fills the highest heavens, Deep and wide and full and free, Love that dwells in God's heart only, His full Heart He gives to us. <br> <br> 4 Wondrous love, I cannot measure, I believe in this great Love. Jesus loves me, Satan hates me, Evil forces me, assail. Jesus loves me now and ever, Help me to love you in turn, I shall sing Thy praises ever, To you pleasant love I'll give. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
