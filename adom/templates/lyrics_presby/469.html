Salvation from sin we have now God gave from His own glory No work of man can take away The sin we have committed By faith alone we have Gods gift The grace that came in Jesus Christ Jesus atoned for sinners <br/><br/>2 In the Commandments of the Lord No one can gain salvation The great Commandments point to sin Condemn and curse us bring death There is no strength in this frail flesh We cannot keep the Law of God In this we all are guilty <br> <br> 3 It was not for our righteousness God gave these great Commandments The Lord God knows none can please Him There is none who is righteous Against the Law we see our sin We see how wretched we all are The Law condemns and kills us <br> <br> 4 We have no power to save ourselves The flesh is strong and lustful The more we try to keep the Law The more sin is magnified Condemnation of God we face No flesh can meet Gods standards here We were all born as sinners <br> <br> 5 Because Christ Jesus satisfied What God expects of sinners All those that trust in Jesus Christ By faith are counted righteous Through Jesus death we have new life We now have new life in Jesus Our substitute is Jesus <br> <br> 6 I have no doubt You are Savior Your Word is Truth I believe There is no fear for sinners here For Christ has died to save us Those that believe in Jesus Christ And are baptized In Him as Lord They shall have life eternal <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
