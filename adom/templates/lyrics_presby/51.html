You are Life and Joy and Savior, You are source of all my being, Son of God, my Lord, None compares with you. <br/><br/>2 Full life you gave me, You came, rescued me. You are God of my salvation, By your death, you gave me new life. By the Blood you shed, You restored my soul. <br> <br> 3 Light of God you are, Christ, eternal Lord. You gave up your life to save us, You became flesh like all humans. When God's time had come, Light of God appeared. <br> <br> 4 Christ, victorious God, You are Savior Lord. You took sin away to save us, Lord, you conquered death and Satan. From this sacrifice, We have all been blessed. <br> <br> 5 When I leave this earth, Grant me peace in death. Bring me to be with you Jesus, Clothe me in your righteousness, God. Grant that I might be, At your right side, Lord! <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
