Our gracious God, is full of mercy, Who shall comprehend such great love? Let not your heart be hardened, sinner, Come to Him, give Him thanks for love. His love is full and free for us all, I must praise Him for He is good. He has not forgotten us sinners, I shall not forget Christ the Lord. <br/><br/>2 Who gives me life to move about here? I regard not God who gives life. Who watches over me, protects me? I rebel against God that keeps. God suffers long and waits patiently, God is slow to express His wrath. He waits for me to seek His mercies, He pardons sin, a new heart gives. <br> <br> 3 Should I have no regard for Jesus? Should I not worship Christ the Lord? He calls me always, I must listen, And follow Him, walk in His ways. His Word I have now hid in my heart, His Word is sure, is truth indeed. His Word shows me to love God always, Love others as, I love myself. <br> <br> 4 Thy gracious works are all before me, I shall not forget all your works. Fill me and bless me with your Love, Lord, That I might please you, love you Lord. In trouble and in suffering in life, Remind me of your love for me, And when I breathe my last on this earth, Remind me of your love for me. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
