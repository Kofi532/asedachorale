Mountains may be moved and vanish, But God's grace forever stands, God has spoken and has promised, Everlasting is His Word. Covenant God abiding, Nothing can our faith destroy. <br/><br/>2 In God's Word, we have great promise, In this Word we trust only, In this Word we have great comfort, We are blessed with such great peace. All flesh and blood shall perish, But God's grace forever stands. <br> <br> 3 We are strengthened by God's promise, Fear and mourning cease in Christ, For He gives us peace eternal, Peace transcending all man's thoughts. When you always trust in God, You shall fear no evil foe. <br> <br> 4 When your sins distress, alarm you, Know His Word assures and prunes, By His Word, you are forgiven, Christ forgives you all your sins. Great mercy of Christ, Lord, No damnation you must dread. <br> <br> 5 Have great confidence in God's Word, Rock on which your faith must rest, This shall be the great assurance, Death's great fright you'll overcome. Death shall be a gate to heav'n, Everlasting peace shall have. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
