You are eternal God, You fill the whole creation. You are the same always, You are the source of life, All things shall pass away, Lord you are evermore. <br/><br/>2 Thy works, O Lord, we see, You planned from eternity. Nothing is hid from you, You know our thoughts and hearts, Lord. You know our days and life, You know our struggles here, Our days are all numbered, You have them in your Book. <br> <br> 3 Your knowledge is so vast, Surpassing what we know here. With knowledge you made all, The earth and heav'ns created. Knowledge most wonderful, We now find in the plan, The plan to save mankind, The plan we see in Christ. <br> <br> 4 You are most selfless God, And you are God of all peace. Nothing you need in life, All that you have you gave us. Provider God you are, You give us all we need, All those that trust in you, Testify of your power. <br> <br> 5 We are before you Lord, In great humility, bow. Give us the grace to come, With thanks in heart and spirit. With open hearts we come, Search Lord our hearts to see, What is not right in them, Cleanse our hearts, make them pure. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
