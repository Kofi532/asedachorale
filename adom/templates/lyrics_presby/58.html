Our living God and Lord, creator of this world, He is the Sunshine and a Shield for His Saints. He strengthens me by His Spirit and by His Word, His Spirit dwells in me, He strengthens my faith. He gently holds my hands and leads me by waters, The Lord protects me and saves me from all evil. I shall not cease praising, God's Holy Name here now. <br/><br/>2 All people now listen to what the Lord seeks now, The Lord loves to give you good things that will last. Wide open your mouths now to receive God's blessings, Come taste of His goodness, you'll know God is good. God has so much for you, what you taste is little, Great things God has done for so many believers. The blessings of the Lord are so rich and so free. <br> <br> 3 Are you so satisfied in this life you live in? If you have all you need then seek not the Lord. Those that are much burdened with sin and temptations, All heavy laden ones come to Jesus Christ. All Saints of Christ Jesus, they have strength to stand here, Stand strong against evil and trials and suffering. In Christ they have strength to, withstand all great foes here. <br> <br> 4 All those that have great faith and trust in Christ Jesus, They all shall stand so firm against trials here. All lazy ones suffer and yield to temptations, The brave and strong conquer, with vict'ry in Christ. Such ones trust in Jesus, they pray to seek His face, They feed on His Word to prepare them for mission. They shall receive blessings, reward from the Lord God. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
