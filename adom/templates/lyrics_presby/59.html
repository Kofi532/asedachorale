By Word you did create, You made the earth and heaven. You spoke and all things came, At your command they came. Your power sustains them all, Your mercy is so great. <br/><br/>2 You are Almighty God, The heav'ns, declare your glory. Thy wondrous works are seen, All things reveal your glory. In great humility, I sing your praise with thanks. Salvation that I have, Comes from you Mighty God! <br> <br> 3 When I look at the heav'ns, The moon and stars established. The sun and seas and all, And all you have created. I marvel, and I ask, What is man that you made? So much you care for him, You love him more than all. <br> <br> 4 You care for us your sheep, Food, raiment all you gave us. You care so much for us, You crowned us with your glory. My inward parts you knew, Before my birth, you knew. You knew me all too well, How wonderful Thy works. <br> <br> 5 You blessed me with so much, And troubles you permitted. In Thy book is written, All days you did assign me. In life you sustain me, You bear me gently through. You seek repentant hearts, Your mercy is so great. <br> <br> 6 When I have you O, Lord, I shall leave all and follow. If I am yours, O Lord, What pleasure shall I seek here? Lord you have asked of me, My heart and all my being, Help me to keep to you, You are my Lord and God. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
