See how hard it is to follow the Lord The Spirit gives life to us now by faith here Gods Spirit gives us new life in this flesh For we daily die for Jesus Christ our Lord Each victory helps us other battles fight The war is on <br/><br/>2 When you shall trample serpents as Christ said Their poison seeks to penetrate it harms not We must be watchful and be prayerful That evil shall not poison us destroy us To seek to follow in the path of Christ The cross must bear <br> <br> 3 Fight the good fight with the strength you have now With perseverance as your Lord a crown awaits The things eternal the soul must seek now Dwell on what youll receive from God this shall last Sorrow and pain shall face you in this life Look to the Lord <br> <br> 4 The Lord God sees all that happens in life He shall supply abundantly all you need Rich treasures reserved in Heaven for you In this life you have but a taste what youll have Nothing can take away reward for you It is with God <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
