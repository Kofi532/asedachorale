His kindness leads me all the way, My heart and mouth, tell of His Love. For He forgives me all my sin, He heals diseases of mine, He saves my life from danger, My soul He frees from death, He pours His grace upon me, As eagle, my strength He renews, Jehovah shall protect His own, His suffering ones He'll defend. <br/><br/>2 The Lord reveals His righteousness, And takes the side of those oppressed. And even in the wilderness, He proved His power to the distressed. His mercy is forever sure, His anger slow and controlled, He keeps us in His kindness, His patience is untold, His grace is high as heaven, For all those who honor His Name, Our sin, Jesus has forgiven, Our sin, He has washed away. <br> <br> 3 As fathers show compassion here, For little children they all have, So God our Lord is merciful, Towards the people that fear Him. He knows our nature and our ways, He knows we are only dust. We are like grass that withers, Like flowers of the fields; When scorching winds come over, They dry up and perish quickly. So we dry up and perish here, Both small and the great alike. <br> <br> 4 God's love and goodness never fails, For those that fear His Holy Name. For those that follow His commands, And walk before Him without blame. God's Throne is firm in highest Heav'n, He rules as King over all. You strong and mighty angels, Who always do His Will, You heav'nly powers come praise Him, Almighty God servants you are, And you my soul join in His praise, And worship the Lord your God. <br> <br> 5 We all must come and give much thanks, To God the Father, Son, Spirit. God's promises have come to pass, His blessings we have all received. Our hope is now in God the Lord, In Him we now trust always. We have become His children, We must cling to our God, Our safety is in Jesus, Secure we are even to death, In this, we all unite to sing, â€˜Hallelujah and Amen'! <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
