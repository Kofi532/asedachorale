For His love is never-ceasing, And His kindness on our way; With His mercy and protection, He is with His children still. And with all that do His will, In this world of imperfection; Everything in this world ends, But God's love for ever stands <br/><br/>2 As an eagle spreads its feathers, Covering its little ones; So the arm of God is ever, Stretched above His trusting sons; He knew us from the beginning, He will keep us till at last. When this earthly life is past, We shall praise Him, gladly singing; Everything in this world ends, But God's love forever stands <br> <br> 3 He sent His dear Son to save us, Save us from sin and from hell. Through His blood, He dearly gave us, Freedom from the devil's spell; O how generous is His mercy, How can any human mind, Through its wisdom ever find, All the depths of God's great mercy, Everything in this world ends, But God's love forever stands <br> <br> 4 By His Spirit, He will guide us, By His Word, He leads us on. Let the world with scorn deride us, We belong to His dear Son. He will fill our hearts with courage, And with faith and heav'nly light, He will overcome all fright, Even death and hell's disparage. Everything in this world ends, But God's love forever stands. <br> <br> 5 By the love of God His Father, Jesus keeps my soul from harm, When the flesh is weak and troubled, I repair to Him for help. When I feel so weak and helpless, When all hope is gone away. Then the Lord comes close to me, Fresh hope and life I have from Him. Everything in this world ends, But God's love forever stands. <br> <br> 6 When I sleep the Lord is with me, Peaceful rest I have in Him. In the morning when I wake up, I declare His gracious care. If the Lord shall not protect me, Human watch is all in vain, I shall quickly perish here, Suffer danger and destruction. Everything in this world ends, But God's love forever stands. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
