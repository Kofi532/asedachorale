Great priceless treasures we have found, All hope in God the Father. They shall find rich blessings in Him, They shall have great freedom in Him. <br/><br/>2 The One who cares for me and feeds, Who prospers the work I do, He is the Lord in all my life. He shows me the way to life, He leads me through the dangerous ways, My helper He will always be. <br> <br> 3 Some toil so hard for vain things here, They earthly things they seek for. They spend much time for all vain [things. I must seek what is so precious. True life and true pleasure I'll seek, Seek that which lasts forever more. <br> <br> 4 A living hope great pleasure gives, Father, grant me this hope now. Bless me with life eternal Lord, My soul, my flesh and spirit; I seek now to glorify God, I commit all to His own care. <br> <br> 5 In His love He knows my life time, He has planned all things for me, In His own time all things shall be. I shall leave all things to Christ, For He knows all the best for me, His will be done for me in life. <br> <br> 6 So long as I live here on earth, I'll yield to His ordaining. My trust is in Christ Jesus now, None else I trust in this life, What is of worth is God's will done, For all His promises shall stand. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
