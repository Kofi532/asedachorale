The Church of Christ, come now to sing, Come with much pleasure and joy. Sing joyful songs together now, Sing of the grace of Jesus. Sing of the blessings from the Lord, His wondrous works declare to all, Sing of His pleasant works here. <br/><br/>2 I was once in the devil's camp, I had no hope of life, dead. I struggled, wrestled in my sin, From birth I suffered distress. In sin I lived in bondage here, No good thing dwelt in me to do, Sin was my master and lord. <br> <br> 3 My wretched state did move your heart, You had compassion for me; You remembered your mercy Lord, And you resolved to save me. The fullness of your heart you poured, You did what was impossible. You gave your heart to a wretch. <br> <br> 4 The Father sent His only Son, At the right time He did send. He sent His own begotten Son, That He might save us from sin. He sent Him to take sin away, And conquer death by His, own Death, He came that we may have life. <br> <br> 5 What I am Lord and have become, Is from You Christ, it is Your gift. Come Kingdom of our God, come now, Establish glory of God. Beloved friend, be careful here, That you may not be led astray, Be in Christ Jesus ever. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
