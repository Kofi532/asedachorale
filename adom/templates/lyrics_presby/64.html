How pure the soul must be When, placed within Thy searching sight, It shrinks not, but with calm delight Can live, and look on Thee! <br/><br/>2 The spirits that surround Thy throne May bear the burning bliss; But that is surely theirs alone, Since they have never, never known A fallen world like this. <br> <br> 3 O how shall I, whose native sphere Is dark, whose mind is dim, Before the Ineffable appear, And on my naked spirit bear That uncreated beam? <br> <br> 4 There is a way for man to rise To that sublime abode: An offering and a sacrifice, A Holy Spirit's energies, An Advocate with God. <br> <br> 5 These, these prepare us for the sight Of holiness above; The sons of ignorance and night, May dwell in the eternal Light, Through the eternal Love. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
