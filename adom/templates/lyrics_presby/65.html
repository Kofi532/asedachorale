We acknowledge all our struggles, Lord of mercy, see our plight. Come to us, in Thy compassion, Come and save us wretched people. <br/><br/>2 We are nothing, dear Lord Jesus, All is dark around us here. And we struggle with the devil, Deadly venom he sends out. All our life is poisoned by him, We are doomed, without your help, Lord <br> <br> 3 Come and guide us in your Way, Lord, In this only we have hope. Traps of evil are about us, Satan's net is over us. Life is filled with deceit and fear, Suffering is our lot on this earth. <br> <br> 4 We are cast down, dear Lord Jesus, No hope is there for the sick. Our best strength is weak and nothing, Life is vain here in this earth, We are humans frail and so weak, We lack strength to live for you, Lord. <br> <br> 5 Come now Lord, we pray you Jesus, Come as light and strengthen us. Open Lord our eyes and hearts now, Grant us grace to see your love. Sun of righteousness shine on us, Fill our hearts with peace from you, Lord. <br> <br> 6 In this Lord, we'll offer praises, Praise you from our hearts and being. We shall come before you Jesus, Come with joy to worship you. Let this whole earth sing your praises, Laud and honor Jesus ever. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
