He came down from God to save us, Save us from death in our sin. <br/><br/>2 For our sake, Christ took frail flesh here, He became poor like all men. He became a Lamb from God now, Death eternal, saved us from. <br> <br> 3 For our sin Christ suffered anguish, Bore the wages of our sin. Bore the curse we all deserve now, Christ has saved His own from death. <br> <br> 4 Jesus Christ suffered for sinners, Heav'nly joy from Him we have. By His death and resurrection, We now have eternal life. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
