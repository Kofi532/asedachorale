One before whom, all must bow, Lay before Him prostrate here, Jesus, God who came in flesh.  <br/><br/>2 There is â€˜One', who bore the load, Burden of the world He bore. One who paid sin's debt for all, Bore the world's sin to the grave. Jesus, One was crucified.  <br> <br> 3 There is â€˜One', who gave us light, Light to see in this dark world. Light from God to give us hope, We behold this light of God, Jesus, who rose from the dead.  <br> <br> 4 Who atoned for all our sin? Sacrificed His life for sin? He must be High Priest for all, For all sinners here on earth, Jesus, â€˜One', who reigns in heav'n.  <br> <br> 5 There is â€˜One', who is righteous, One who glorified the Lord. This â€˜One' beckons all on earth, Seeks to gather now His bride, Jesus, He will come again.  <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
