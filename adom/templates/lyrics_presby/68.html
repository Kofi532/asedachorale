God made us so beautiful beings, Sin has come to ruin us all. <br/><br/>2 Earth is full of pain and trouble, Hatred, envy, strife, we see. Flesh is strong, has overcome us, We are full of lust and greed. <br> <br> 3 Sin of Adam, our first father, Has corrupted humankind. Wages for our sin against God, Death eternal is our due. <br> <br> 4 Who can save us from such trouble? Who can save us once for all? Who can pay the wages of sin? Who can bear the curse for us? <br> <br> 5 Son of God, our Lord, Christ Jesus, He who comes from God in heav'n; He has died the death of sinners, He paid all the wages due. <br> <br> 6 Dear Lord Jesus, Lord of mercy, Look upon our misery. Save us from this world of evil, Grant us life eternal now. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
