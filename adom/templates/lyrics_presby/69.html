I know of a dear Friend, A friend from God above, Jesus the Christ, God's dear Son He came down from, above.  <br/><br/>2 God loved this world so much He gave His only Son. Christ Jesus left His glory, He came to die for us.  <br> <br> 3 God sacrificed Jesus, He gave Him for our sin. So come to Him my brother Give all your heart to Him.  <br> <br> 4 If you love Christ Jesus, To whom none can compare. Then come with me to Jesus, He cares so much for you.  <br> <br> 5 He came for salvation, For sinful man He came. With His own Blood He bought us, What priceless gift from God.  <br> <br> 6 There's no one like Jesus, Who loves you dearly, friend. So come to Him my brother, Come now to Christ the Lord.  <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
