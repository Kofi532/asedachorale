The length, and breadth, and height to prove And depth of sovereign grace? <br/><br/>2 Thy sovereign grace to all extend, Immense and unconfined; From age to age it never ends, It reaches all mankind. <br> <br> 3 Throughout the world its breadth is [known, Wide as infinity, So wide it never passed by one; Or it had passed by me. <br> <br> 4 My trespass was grown up to Heav'n; But far above the skies, In Christ abundantly forgiv'n, I see Thy mercies rise! <br> <br> 5 The depth of all-redeeming love, What angel-tongue can tell? O may I to the utmost prove The gift unspeakable! <br> <br> 6 Deeper than hell, it plucked me thence; Deeper than inbred sin: Jesus' love my heart shall cleanse, When Jesus enters in. <br> <br> 7 Assert Thy claim, receive Thy right, Come quickly from above, And sink me to perfection's height, The depth of humble love. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
