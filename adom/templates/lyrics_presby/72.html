Praise to the Holiest in the height, And in the depth be praise; In all His words most wonderful, Most sure in all His ways. <br/><br/>2 O loving wisdom of our God! When all was sin and shame, A second Adam to the fight And to the rescue came. <br> <br> 3 O wisest love! that flesh and blood, Which did in Adam fail, Should strive afresh against the foe, Should strive and should prevail. <br> <br> 4 And that a higher gift than grace Should flesh and blood refine, God's Presence and His very Self, And Essence all divine. <br> <br> 5 O generous love! that He, who smote, In Man for man the foe, The double agony in Man For man should undergo. <br> <br> 6 And in the garden secretly, And on the Cross on high, Should teach His brethren, and inspire To suffer and to die. <br> <br> 1 Praise to the Holiest in the height, And in the depth be praise; In all His words most wonderful, Most sure in all His ways. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
