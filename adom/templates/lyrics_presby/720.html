Sun of my soul Thou Savior dear It is not night if thou be near O may no earthborn cloud arise To hide thee from Thine servants eyes <br/><br/>2 When the soft dews of kindly sleep My wearied eyelids gently sleep Be my last thought how sweet to rest Forever on my Saviors breast <br> <br> 3 Abide with me from morn till eve For without Thee I cannot live Abide with me when night is nigh For without Thee I dare not die <br> <br> 4 If some poor wandering child of Thine Has spurned today the voice divine Now Lord the gracious work begin Let him no more lie down in sin <br> <br> 5 Watch by the sick enrich the poor With blessings from Thy boundless store Be every mourners sleep tonight Like infants slumbers pure and right <br> <br> 6 Come near and bless us when we wake Ere through the world our way we take Till in the ocean of Thy love We lose ourselves in heaven above <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
