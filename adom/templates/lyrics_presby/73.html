Not what my hands have done Can save my guilty soul; Not what my toiling flesh has borne Can make my spirit whole. <br/><br/>2 Not what I feel or do Can give me peace with God; Not all my prayers and sighs and tears Can bear my awful load. <br> <br> 3 Thy work alone, O Christ, Can ease this weight of sin; Thy blood alone, O Lamb of God, Can give me peace within. <br> <br> 4 Thy love to me, O God, Not mine, O Lord to thee, Can rid me of this dark unrest And set my spirit free. <br> <br> 5 Thy grace alone, O God, To me can pardon speak; Thy pow'r alone, O Son of God, Can this sore bondage break. <br> <br> 6 I bless the Christ of God; I rest on love divine; And with unfalt'ring lip and heart I call this Saviour mine. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
