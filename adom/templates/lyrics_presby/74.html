All mankind became so sinful, No cure could be found for sin. Only God, from sin could save us, From the wages of sin save. And the curse on earth for sinning, Wrath of God had been on us. <br/><br/>2 Eve became deceived by Satan, She fell in the evil trap. She forsook, the Lord her maker, And she passed sin on to all. And all died for sin committed, But God sent His only Son, He became man, our sin He bore, By His death, He saved us all. <br> <br> 3 Sinful nature, Adam had then, We all shared Adam's nature. By the work of Savior Jesus, We have all been blessed with life. As we all died in Adam's sin, Death eternal we all faced. But through Christ, God's only Son's death, Children of God we are now. <br> <br> 4 While yet sinners and without hope, God gave Christ as gift to us. On the Cross, Christ died for sinners, He arose from death to life. He ascended up to Heaven, And He sat on God's Right Hand. If we have faith in Christ Jesus, We shall be with Him in Heav'n. <br> <br> 5 Jesus is the Way to Heaven, He is life and truth and grace. God's Word Jesus spoke and taught us, He Himself is that Word too. He atoned for sin for all men, He reconciled us to God. All that, come to Him believing, Life eternal He gives them. <br> <br> 6 Those with faith in Christ as Savior, And do trust in Jesus Christ. They shall not have any worries, For their Rock is Jesus Christ. In this world they'll suffer evil, But they'll not suffer the hell. They shall be with Christ in Heaven, God Himself shall be with them. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
