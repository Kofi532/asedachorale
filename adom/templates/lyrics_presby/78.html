As of old the waters covered, All the earth, destroyed all life, So the day shall come upon us, This earth shall be up in smoke that day. Day shall come, day shall come, God shall burn this earth with fire. <br/><br/>2 My Lord God, my Lord God, Grant me Lord a Saint to be. That when you shall burn this planet, I shall hide in you my God, Save me as the Ark of Noah Save me from destruction of the earth. My Lord God, my Lord God; Grant me Lord a Saint to be. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
