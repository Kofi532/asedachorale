Let creation From her groans and travail cease; Let the glorious proclamation Hope restore and faith increase; Christ is coming! Christ is coming! Come, Thou blessèd Prince of Peace. <br/><br/>2 Earth can now but tell the story Of Thy bitter cross and pain; She shall yet behold Thy glory, When Thou comest back to reign; Christ is coming! Christ is coming! Let each heart repeat the strain. <br> <br> 3 Though once cradled in a manger, Oft no pillow but the sod; Here an alien and a stranger, Mocked of men, disowned of God. Christ is coming! Christ is coming! Come, Thou blessÃ¨d Prince of Peace! <br> <br> 4 Long Thine exiles have been pining, Far from rest, and home, and Thee; But, in heav'nly vestures shining, They their loving Lord shall see; Christ is coming! Christ is coming! Haste the joyous jubilee. <br> <br> 5 With that blessÃ¨d hope before us, Let no harp remain unstrung; Let the mighty Advent chorus Onward roll from tongue to tongue: â€œChrist is coming! Christ is coming! Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come!â€ <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
