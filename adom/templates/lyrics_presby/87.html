O come, O come, Immanuel, And ransom captive Israel, That mourns in lonely exile here Until the Son of God appear. Refrain: Rejoice! Rejoice! Immanuel, shall come to thee, O Israel. <br/><br/>2 O come, Thou Wisdom from on high, Who orderest all things mightily; To us the path of knowledge show, And teach us in her ways to go. Refrain <br> <br> 3 O come, Thou Rod of Jesse, free Thine own from Satan's tyranny; From depths of hell Thy people save, And give them victory o'er the grave. Refrain <br> <br> 4 O come, Thou Day-spring, come and cheer Our spirits by Thine Advent here; Disperse the gloomy clouds of night, And death's dark shadows put to flight. Refrain <br> <br> 5 O come, Thou Key of David, come, And open wide our heavenly home; Make safe the way that leads on high, And close the path to misery.
