Salvation comes from you, You came to save us, not angels. Lord you did come, For all sinners on this earth, Gracious Lord, you are, so loving. <br/><br/>2 We have great hope in Christ, Who is our life and salvation. He came to save the poor, Therefore all sinners come draw near. His glory shines, Hope of glory we now have, Now we belong to Christ Jesus. <br> <br> 3 The Lord of Hosts came down, He left His glory in heaven. This Holy God came down, Dwelt here with sinners, He loves much. All who approached, He received and He welcomed All who cried to Him, He heard them. <br> <br> 4 Come to us Lord of Life, The Hope of years, you are here now. Save Lord your people now, Save us from sin and from evil. Cast out our sin, Lord, drive away the great foe. Come Mighty King to deliver. <br> <br> 5 Sow seed of faith in us, Deepen this faith in you Jesus. May this faith grow so strong, And bear much fruit for your glory. In every work, Give us faith to overcome, Help us to trust you Lord Jesus. <br> <br> 6 Hosanna, come to rescue us, [Lord Jesus we welcome. Come Savior Lord to teach your [Word, and share the Gospel news. When we complete, All our journey on this earth, Bring us Home with you in Heaven. <br> <br> </p> <!-- Added line with the requested string --> <a href="/solfa/">Read and play tonic-solfa notes</a>             {% endblock %}
