        <p><br>1 BelovÃ¨d, let us love: for love is of God; <br> in God alone love has its true abode. <br> <br>2 BelovÃ¨d, let us love: for those who love, <br> they only, are his sons, born from above. <br> <br>3 BelovÃ¨d, let us love: for love is rest, <br> and he who loveth not abides unblest. <br> <br>4 BelovÃ¨d, let us love: for love is light, <br> and he who loveth not dwelleth in night. <br> <br>5 BelovÃ¨d, let us love: for only thus <br> shall we behold that God who loveth us. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>298</p>
