        <p><br>1 I could not do without thee, <br> O Saviour of the lost, <br> whose precious blood redeemed me <br> at such tremendous cost; <br> thy righteousness, thy pardon, <br> thy precious blood, must be <br> my only hope and comfort, <br> my glory and my plea. <br> <br>2 I could not do without thee, <br> I cannot stand alone, <br> I have no strength or goodness, <br> no wisdom of my own; <br> but thou, belovÃ¨d Saviour, <br> art all in all to me, <br> and weakness will be power <br> if leaning hard on thee. <br> <br>3 I could not do without thee, <br> for, oh, the way is long, <br> and I am often weary, <br> and sigh replaces song: <br> how could I do without thee? <br> I do not know the way; <br> thou knowest, and thou leadest, <br> and wilt not let me stray. <br> <br>4 I could not do without thee, <br> O Jesus, Saviour dear; <br> eÂen when my eyes are holden, <br> I know that thou art near; <br> how dreary and how lonely <br> this changeful life would be <br> without the sweet communion, <br> the secret rest with thee. <br> <br>5 I could not do without thee; <br> no other friend can read <br> the spiritÂs strange deep longings, <br> interpreting its need; <br> no human heart could enter <br> each dim recess of mine, <br> and soothe, and hush, and calm it, <br> O BlessÃ¨d Lord, but thine. <br> <br>6 I could not do without thee, <br> for years are fleeting fast, <br> and soon in solemn loneness <br> the river must be passed; <br> but thou wilt never leave me, <br> and though the waves roll high, <br> I know thou wilt be near me, <br> and whisper, 'It is I.' <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>472</p>
