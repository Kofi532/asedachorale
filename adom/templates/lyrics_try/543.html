        <p><br><br>1 Jesu, my strength, my hope, <br> on thee I cast my care, <br> with humble confidence look up, <br> and know thou hearest my prayer. <br> Give me on thee to wait, <br> till I can all things do, <br> on thee, almighty to create. <br> almighty to renew. <br> <br><br>2 I want a godly fear, <br> a quick-discerning eye <br> that looks to thee when sin is near, <br> and bids the tempter fly; <br> a spirit still prepared, <br> and armed with jealous care, <br> for ever standing on its guard, <br> and watching unto prayer. <br> <br><br>3 I want a true regard, <br> a single, steady aim, <br> unmoved by threatening or reward, <br> to thee and thy great name; <br> a jealous, just concern <br> for thine immortal praise; <br> a pure desire that all may learn <br> and glorify thy grace. <br> <br><br>4 I rest upon thy word; <br> thy promise is for me: <br> my succour and salvation, Lord, <br> shall surely come from thee: <br> but let me still abide, <br> nor from my hope remove; <br> till thou my patient spirit guide <br> into thy perfect love. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br><br>485</p>
