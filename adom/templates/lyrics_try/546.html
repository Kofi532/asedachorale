        <p><br>1 Come, Saviour, Jesus, from above! <br> Assist me with thy heavenly grace; <br> Empty my heart of earthly love, <br> And for Thyself prepare the place. <br> <br>2 O let Thy sacred presence fill, <br> And set my longing spirit free; <br> Which pants to have no other will, <br> But night and day to feast on Thee. <br> <br>3 While in this region here below, <br> No other good will I pursue: <br> I'll bid this world of noise and show, <br> With all its glitt'ring snares, adieu. <br> <br>4 That path with humble speed I'll seek, <br> In which my Saviour's footsteps shine; <br> Now will I hear, nor will I speak, <br> Of any other love but Thine. <br> <br>5 Henceforth may no profane delight <br> Divide this consecrated soul: <br> Possess it thou, who hast the right, <br> As Lord and Master of the whole. <br> <br>6 Nothing on earth do I desire, <br> But thy pure love within my breast; <br> This, only this, will I require, <br> And freely give up all the rest. <br>  <br> Source: The A.M.E.
