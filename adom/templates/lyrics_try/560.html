        <p><br>1 Jesus hath died that I might live, <br> Might live to God alone; <br> In Him eternal life receive, <br> And be in spirit one. <br> <br>2 Saviour, I thank thee for the grace, <br> The gift unspeakable: <br> And wait with arms of faith tÂembrace, <br> And all Thy love to feel. <br> <br>3 My soul breaks out in strong desire <br> The perfect bliss to prove; <br> My longing heart is all on fire <br> To be dissolved in love. <br> <br>4 Give me thyself; from every boast, <br> From every wish set free; <br> Let all I am in thee be lost, <br> But give Thyself to me. <br> <br>5 Thy gifts, alas! cannot suffice <br> Unless Thyself be given; <br> Thy presence makes my paradise, <br> And where Thou art is heaven. <br>  <br> Source: Songs of Praise and Salvation #<br>80</p>
