        <p><br>1 God of all power, and truth, and grace, <br> which shall from age to age endure, <br> whose word, when heaven and earth shall pass, <br> remains and stands for ever sure; <br> <br>2 That I thy mercy may proclaim, <br> that all mankind thy truth may see, <br> hallow thy great and glorious name, <br> and perfect holiness in me. <br> <br>3 Thy sanctifying Spirit pour <br> to quench my thirst and make me clean; <br> now, Father, let the gracious shower <br> descend, and make me pure from sin. <br> <br>4 Give me a new, a perfect heart, <br> from doubt, and fear, and sorrow free; <br> the mind which was in Christ impart, <br> and let my spirit cleave to thee. <br> <br>5 O that I now, from sin released, <br> thy word may to the utmost prove, <br> enter into the promised rest, <br> the Canaan of thy perfect love! <br>  <br> Source: Common Praise: A new edition of Hymns Ancient and Modern #<br>446</p>
