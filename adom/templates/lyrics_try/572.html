        <p><br>1 Behold the servant of the Lord! <br> I wait thy guiding eye to feel, <br> To hear and keep thy ev'ry word, <br> To prove and do thy perfect will; <br> Joyful from my own works to cease, <br> Glad to fulfil all righteousness. <br> <br>2 Me if thy grace vouchsafe to use, <br> Meanest of all thy creatures, me, <br> The deed, the time, the manner chuse, <br> Let all my fruit be found of thee; <br> Let all my works in thee be wrought, <br> By thee to full perfection brought. <br> <br>3 My ev'ry weak, though good design, <br> OÂer-rule, or change, as seems thee meet; <br> Jesu, let all my work be thine! <br> Thy work, O Lord, is all compleat, <br> And pleasing in thy FatherÂs sight; <br> Thou only hast done all things right. <br> <br>4 Here then to thee thy own I leave, <br> Mould as thou wilt thy passive clay; <br> But let me all thy stamp receive, <br> But let me all thy words obey: <br> Serve with a single heart and eye, <br> And to thy glory live and die. <br>  <br> Source: A Pocket Hymn Book: designed as a constant companion for the pious, collected from various authors (<br>9th ed.) #LXXXIII</p>
