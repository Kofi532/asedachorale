        <p><br>1 O God, what offering shall I give <br> To thee, the Lord of earth and skies? <br> My spirit, soul and flesh receive, <br> A holy, living sacrifice; <br> Small as it is, Âtis all my store, <br> More shouldst thou have if I had more. <br> <br>2 Now, O my God, thou hast my soul, <br> No longer mine, but thine I am; <br> Guard thou thine own, possess it whole, <br> Cheer it with hope, with love inflame; <br> Thou hast my spirit, there display <br> Thy glory to the perfect day. <br> <br>3 Thou hast my flesh, thy hallowed shrine, <br> Devoted solely to thy will; <br> Here let thy light for ever shine, <br> This house still let thy presence fill; <br> O Source of life, live, dwell and move <br> In me, till all my life be love! <br> <br>4 Send down thy likeness from above, <br> And let this my adorning be; <br> Clothe me with wisdom, patience, love, <br> With lowliness and purity, <br> Than gold and pearls more precious far, <br> And brighter than the morning star. <br> <br>5 Lord, arm me with thy SpiritÂs might, <br> Since I am called by thy great name; <br> In thee let all my thoughts unite, <br> Of all my works be thou the aim; <br> Thy love attend me all my days, <br> And my sole business be thy praise. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: The Song Book of the Salvation Army #<br>516</p>
