        <p><br>1 Holy Lamb, who Thee confess, <br> Followers of Thy holiness, <br> Thee they ever keep in view, <br> Ever ask, "What shall we do?" <br> Governed by Thy only will, <br> All Thy words we would fulfil; <br> Would in all Thy footsteps go, <br> Walk as Jesus walked below. <br> <br>2 While Thou didst on earth appear, <br> Servant to Thy servants here, <br> Mindful of Thy place above, <br> All Thy life was prayer and love. <br> Such our whole employment be, <br> Works of faith and charity; <br> Works of love on man bestowed, <br> Secret intercourse with God. <br> <br>3 Early in the temple met, <br> Let us still our Saviour greet; <br> Nightly to the mount repair, <br> Join our praying Pattern there. <br> There by wrestling faith obtain <br> Power to work for God again, <br> Power His image to retrieve, <br> Power, like Thee, our Lord, to live. <br> <br>4 Vessels, instruments of grace, <br> Pass we thus our happy days <br> 'Twixt the mount and multitude. <br> Doing or receiving good; <br> Glad to pray and labour on, <br> Till our earthly course is run, <br> Till, our sufferings ended, we <br> Bow the head and die like Thee. <br>  <br> Source: Methodist Hymn and Tune Book: official hymn book of the Methodist Church #<br>232</p>
