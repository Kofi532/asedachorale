        <p><br>1 Captain of Israel's host, and guide <br> of all who seek the land above, <br> beneath your shadow we abide, <br> the cloud of your protecting love; <br> our strength, your grace; our rule, your word: <br> our end, the glory of the Lord. <br> <br>2 By your unerring Spirit led, <br> we shall not in the desert stray; <br> we shall not full direction need, <br> nor miss our providential way; <br> as far from danger as from fear <br> while love, almighty love, is near. <br>  <br> Source: Together in Song: Australian hymn book II #<br>574</p>
