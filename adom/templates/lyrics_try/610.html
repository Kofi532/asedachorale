        <p><br>1 Leader of faithful souls, and Guide <br> Of all who travel to the sky, <br> Come, and with us, even us, abide, <br> Who would on Thee alone rely; <br> On Thee alone our spirits stay, <br> While held in life's uneven way. <br> <br>2 Strangers and pilgrims here below, <br> This earth, we know is not our place; <br> But hasten through the vale of woe, <br> And, restless to behold Thy face, <br> Swift to our heavenly country move, <br> Our everlasting home above. <br> <br>3 We've no abiding city here, <br> But seek a city out of sight; <br> Thither our steady course we steer, <br> Aspiring to the plains of light, <br> Jerusalem, the saints' abode, <br> Whose founder is the living God. <br> <br>4 Through Thee, who all our sins hast borne, <br> Freely and graciously forgiven, <br> With songs to Zion we return, <br> Contending for our native heaven, <br> That palace of our glorious King, <br> We find it nearer while we sing. <br> <br>5 Raised by the breath of love divine, <br> We urge our way with strength renewed; <br> The church of the first-born to join, <br> We travel to the mount of God; <br> With joy upon our heads arise, <br> And meet our Captain in the skies. <br>  <br> Source: Methodist Hymn and Tune Book: official hymn book of the Methodist Church #<br>561</p>
