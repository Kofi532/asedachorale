        <p><br>1 Through the night of doubt and sorrow <br> onward goes the pilgrim band, <br> singing songs of expectation, <br> marching to the promised land. <br> <br>2 Clear before us through the darkness <br> gleams and burns the guiding light; <br> pilgrim clasps the hand of pilgrim, <br> stepping fearless through the night. <br> <br>3 One the light of God's own presence <br> o'er his ransomed people shed, <br> chasing far the gloom and terror, <br> brightening all the path we tread: <br> <br>4 One the object of our journey, <br> one the faith which never tires, <br> one the earnest looking forward, <br> one the hope our God inspires: <br> <br>5 One the strain that lips of thousands <br> lift as from the heart of one; <br> one the conflict, one the peril, <br> one the march in God begun: <br> <br>6 One the gladness of rejoicing <br> on the far eternal shore, <br> where the one almighty Father <br> reigns in love for evermore. <br> <br>7 Onward, therefore, Christian pilgrims, <br> onward with the cross our aid; <br> bear its shame, and fight its battle, <br> till we rest beneath its shade. <br> <br>8 Soon shall come the great awaking, <br> soon the rending of the tomb; <br> then the scattering of all shadows, <br> and the end of toil and gloom. <br>  <br> Source: Ancient and Modern: hymns and songs for refreshing worship #<br>813</p>
