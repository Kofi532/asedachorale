        <p><br>1 Forward! be our watchword, <br> Steps and voices joined; <br> Seek the things before us, <br> Not a look behind: <br> Burns the fiery pillar <br> At our armyÂs head; <br> Who shall dream of shrinking, <br> By our Captain led? <br> Forward through the desert, <br> Through the toil and fight; <br> Jordan flows before us, <br> Zion beams with light! <br> <br>2 Forward! flock of Jesus, <br> Salt of all the earth, <br> Till each yearning purpose <br> Springs to glorious birth: <br> Sick, they ask for healing; <br> Blind, they grope for day; <br> Pour upon the nations <br> WisdomÂs loving ray. <br> Forward, out of error, <br> Leave behind the night; <br> Forward through the darkness, <br> Forward into light! <br> <br>3 Glories upon glories <br> Hath our God prepared, <br> By the souls that love Him <br> One day to be shared! <br> Eye hath not beheld them, <br> Ear hath never heard; <br> Nor of these hath uttered <br> Thought or speech a word: <br> Forward, marching eastward <br> Where the heaven is bright. <br> Till the veil be lifted, <br> Till our faith be sight! <br> <br>4 Far o'er yon horizon <br> Rise the city towers, <br> Where our God abideth; <br> That fair home is ours: <br> Flash the streets with jasper, <br> Shine the gates with gold; <br> Flows the gladdening river <br> Shedding joys untold. <br> Thither, onward thither, <br> In the Spirit's might: <br> Pilgrims to your country, <br> Forward into light! <br> AMEN. <br>  <br> Source: The A.M.E.
