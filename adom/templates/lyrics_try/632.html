        <p><br>1 Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart; <br> be all else but naught to me, save that Thou art; <br> be Thou my best thought in the day and the night, <br> both waking and sleeping, Thy presence my light. <br> <br>2 Be Thou my Wisdom, be Thou my true Word; <br> be Thou ever with me and I with Thee, Lord; <br> be Thou my great Father, and I Thy true son, <br> be Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one. <br> <br>3 Be Thou my Breastplate, my Sword for the fight; <br> be Thou my whole Armor, be Thou my true Might; <br> be Thou my soulÂs Shelter, be Thou my strong TowÂr, <br> O raise Thou me heavÂnward, great PowÂr of my powÂr. <br> <br>4 Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise, <br> be Thou mine inheritance, now and always; <br> be Thou and Thou only the first in my heart, <br> O High King of heaven, my Treasure Thou art. <br> <br>5 High King of heaven, Thou heaven's bright Sun, <br> O grant me its joys, after vict'ry is won; <br> Great Heart of my own heart, whatever befall, <br> still be Thou my Vision, O Ruler of all. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God #<br>352</p>
