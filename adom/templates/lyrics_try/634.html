        <p><br>1 Will your anchor hold in the storms of life, <br> when the clouds unfold their wings of strife? <br> When the strong tides lift, and the cables strain, <br> will your anchor drift, or firm remain? <br> Refrain: <br> We have an anchor that keeps the soul <br> steadfast and sure while the billows roll; <br> fastened to the Rock which cannot move, <br> grounded firm and deep in the SaviourÂs love! <br> <br>2 Will your anchor hold in the straits of fear, <br> when the breakers roar and the reef is near? <br> While the surges rage, and the wild winds blow, <br> shall the angry waves then your bark o'erflow? [Refrain] <br> <br>3 Will your anchor hold in the floods of death, <br> when the waters cold chill your latest breath? <br> On the rising tide you can never fail, <br> while your anchor holds within the veil. [Refrain] <br> <br>4 Will your eyes behold through the morning light <br> the city of gold and the harbour bright? <br> Will you anchor safe by the heavenly shore, <br> when life's storms are past for evermore? [Refrain] <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>564</p>
