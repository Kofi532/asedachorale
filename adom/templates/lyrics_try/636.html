        <p><br>1 Light of the world, faint were our weary feet <br> With wandering far; <br> But Thou didst come our lonely hearts to greet, <br> O Morning Star; <br> And Thou didst bid us lift our gaze on high, <br> To see the glory of the glowing sky. <br> <br>2 In days long past we missed our homeward way; <br> We could not see; <br> Blind were our eyes, our feet were bound to stray; <br> How blind to Thee! <br> But Thou didst pity, Lord, our gloomy plight; <br> And Thou didst touch our eyes, and give them sight. <br> <br>3 Now hallelujahs rise along the road <br> Our glad feet tread; <br> Thy love hath shared our sorrow's heavy load; <br> There's light o'erhead: <br> Glory to Thee whose love hath led us on, <br> Glory for all the great things Thou hast done. <br> <br>4 Where is death's sting, where, grave, thy victory, <br> Where all the pain, <br> Now that thy King the veil that hung o'er thee <br> Hath rent in twain? <br> Light of the world, we hear Thee bid us come <br> To light and love in Thine eternal home. <br>  <br> Source: Methodist Hymn and Tune Book: official hymn book of the Methodist Church #<br>114a</p>
