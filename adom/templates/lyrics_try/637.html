        <p><br>1 The sands of time are sinking; <br> the dawn of heaven breaks; <br> the summer morn I've sighed for, <br> the fair sweet morn awakes; <br> dark, dark has been the midnight, <br> but dayspring is at hand, <br> and glory, glory dwelleth <br> in Emmanuel's land. <br> <br>2 The King there in His beauty <br> without a veil is seen; <br> it were a well-spent journey, <br> though trials lay between: <br> the Lamb with His fair army <br> on Zion's mountain stands, <br> and glory, glory dwelleth <br> in Emmanuel's land. <br> <br>3 O Christ, He is the fountain, <br> the deep, sweet well of love! <br> The streams on earth I've tasted; <br> more deep I'll drink above: <br> there to an ocean fullness <br> His mercy doth expand, <br> and glory, glory dwelleth <br> in Emmanuel's land. <br> <br>4 The bride eyes not her garment, <br> but her dear bridegroom's face; <br> I will not gaze at glory, <br> but on my King of grace; <br> not at the crown He giveth, <br> but on His piercÃ©d hands; <br> the Lamb is all the glory <br> of Emmanuel's land. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God #<br>421</p>
