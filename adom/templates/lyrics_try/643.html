        <p><br>1 When this passing world is done, <br> when has sunk yon glaring sun, <br> when we stand with Christ on high <br> looking o'er life's history, <br> then, Lord, shall I fully know, <br> not till then, how much I owe. <br> <br>2 When I hear the wicked call <br> on the rocks and hills to fall, <br> when I see them start and shrink <br> on the fiery deluge brink, <br> then, Lord, shall I fully know, <br> not till then, how much I owe. <br> <br>3 When I stand before the throne, <br> dressed in beauty not my own, <br> when I see thee as thou art, <br> love thee with unsinning heart, <br> then, Lord, shall I fully know, <br> not till then, how much I owe. <br> <br>4 When the praise of heav'n I hear, <br> loud as thunders to the ear, <br> loud as many waters' noise, <br> sweet as harp's melodious voice, <br> then, Lord, shall I fully know, <br> not till then, how much I owe. <br> <br>5 Chosen not for good in me, <br> wakened up from wrath to flee, <br> hidden in the Savior's side, <br> by the Spirit sanctified, <br> teach me, Lord, on earth to show, <br> by my love, how much I owe. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Trinity Psalter Hymnal #<br>470</p>
