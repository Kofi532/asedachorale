        <p><br>1 O day of rest and gladness, <br> O day of joy and light, <br> O balm of care and sadness, <br> most beautiful, most bright; <br> on thee the high and lowly <br> through ages joined in tune, <br> sing "Holy, holy, holy" <br> to the great God Triune. <br> <br>2 On thee, at the creation, <br> the light first had its birth; <br> on thee, for our salvation, <br> Christ rose from depths of earth; <br> on thee, our Lord victorious, <br> the Spirit sent from heav'n; <br> and thus on thee, most glorious, <br> a triple light was giv'n. <br> <br>3 Today on weary nations <br> the heav'nly manna falls; <br> to holy convocations <br> the silver trumpet calls, <br> where gospel light is glowing <br> with pure and radiant beams, <br> and living water flowing <br> with soul refreshing streams. <br> <br>4 New graces ever gaining <br> from this our day of rest, <br> we reach the rest remaining <br> to spirits of the blest. <br> To Holy Ghost be praises, <br> to Father, and to Son; <br> the church her voice upraises <br> to thee, blest Three in One. <br>  <br> Source: Trinity Psalter Hymnal #<br>153</p>
