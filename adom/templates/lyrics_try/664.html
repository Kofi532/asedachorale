        <p><br><br>1 Light of light, enlighten me, <br> now anew the day is dawning; <br> sun of grace, the shadows flee; <br> brighten thou my Sabbath morning; <br> with thy joyous sunshine blest, <br> happy is my day of rest. <br> <br><br>2 Fount of all our joy and peace, <br> to thy living waters lead me; <br> thou from earth my soul release, <br> and with grace and mercy feed me; <br> bless thy Word, that it may prove <br> rich in fruits that thou dost love. <br> <br><br>3 Kindle thou the sacrifice, <br> that upon my lips is lying; <br> clear the shadows from mine eyes, <br> that, from every error flying, <br> no strange fire may in me glow <br> that thine altar doth not know. <br> <br><br>4 Let me with my heart today, <br> "Holy, holy, holy" singing, <br> rapt awhile from earth away, <br> all my soul to thee up-springing, <br> have a foretaste inly giv'n <br> how they worship thee in heav'n. <br> <br><br>5 Hence all care, all vanity, <br> for the day to God is holy; <br> come, thou glorious Majesty, <br> deign to fill this temple lowly; <br> naught today my soul shall move, <br> simply resting in thy love. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Trinity Hymnal (Rev. ed.) #<br><br>397</p>
