        <p><br>1 We rose to-day with anthems sweet <br> To sing before the mercy-seat, <br> And ere the darkness round us fell <br> We bade the grateful vespers swell. <br> <br>2 Whate'ever has risen from heart sincere, <br> Each upward glance of filial fear, <br> Each true resolve, each solemn vow, <br> Jesus our Lord, accept them now. <br> <br>3 Whate'er beneath Thy searching eyes <br> Has wrought to spoil our sacrifice, <br> 'Mid this sweet stillness while we bow, <br> Jesus our Lord, forgive us now. <br> <br>4 O teach us erring souls to win, <br> And hide their multitude of sin, <br> To tread in Christ's longsuffering way, <br> And grow more like Him day by day. <br> <br>5 So as our Sabbaths hasten past, <br> And rounding years bring nigh the last; <br> When sinks the sun behind the hill, <br> When all the weary wheels stand still; <br> <br>6 When by our bed the loved ones weep, <br> And death-dews o'er the forehead creep, <br> And vain is help or hope from men; <br> Jesus our Lord, receive us then. <br>  <br> Source: Methodist Hymn and Tune Book: official hymn book of the Methodist Church #<br>245</p>
