        <p><br>84 DEAR Lord and Father of mankind, <br> Forgive our foolish ways! <br> Re-clothe us in our rightful mind, <br> In purer lives Thy service find, <br> In deeper reverence, praise.<br>2 In simple trust like theirs who heard, <br> Beside the Syrian sea, <br> The gracious calling of the Lord, <br> Let us, like them, without a word <br> Rise up and follow Thee.<br>3 O Sabbath rest by Galilee! <br> O calm of hills above, <br> Where Jesus knelt to share with Thee <br> The silence of eternity, <br> Interpreted by love.<br>4 With that deep hush subduing all <br> Our words and works that drown <br> The tender whisper of Thy call, <br> As noiseless let Thy blessing fall <br> As fell Thy manna down.<br>5 Drop Thy still dews of quietness, <br> Till all our strivings cease; <br> Take from our souls the strain and stress, <br> And let our ordered lives confess <br> The beauty of Thy peace.<br>6 Breathe through the heats of our desire <br> Thy coolness and Thy balm; <br> Let sense be dumb, let flesh retire; <br> Speak through the earthquake, wind, and fire, <br> O still, small voice of calm! <br>  <br> Source: Redemption Hymnal #<br>84a</p>
