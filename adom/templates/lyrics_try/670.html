        <p><br>1. Jesus, Thou soul of all our joys, <br> For whom we now lift up our voice, <br> And all our strength exert; <br> Vouchsafe the grace we humbly claim, <br> Compose into a thankful frame, <br> And tune Thy peoples heart. <br> <br>2. While in the heavenly work we join, <br> Thy glory be our whole design, <br> Thy glory, not our own: <br> Still let us keep our end in view, <br> And still the pleasing task pursue, <br> To please our God alone. <br> <br>3. The secret pride, the subtle sin, <br> O let it never more steal in, <br> To offend Thy glorious eyes, <br> To desecrate our hallowed strain, <br> And make our solemn service vain, <br> And mar our sacrifice! <br> <br>4. To magnify Thy awful name, <br> To spread the honors of the Lamb, <br> Let us our voices raise; <br> Our souls and bodies powers unite, <br> Regardless of our own delight, <br> And dead to human praise. <br> <br>5. Still let us on our guard be found, <br> And watch against the power of sound <br> With sacred jealousy; <br> Lest haply sense should damp our zeal, <br> And musics charms bewitch and steal <br> Our hearts away from Thee. <br> <br>6. That hurrying strife far oft remove, <br> That noisy burst of selfish love, <br> Which swells the formal song; <br> The joy from out our hearts arise, <br> And speak and sparkle in our eyes, <br> And vibrate on our tongue. <br> <br>7. Thee let us praise, our common Lord, <br> And sweetly join with one accord <br> Thy goodness to proclaim: <br> Jesus, Thyself in us reveal, <br> And all our faculties shall feel <br> Thy harmonizing name. <br> <br>8. With calmly reverential joy, <br> O let us all our lives employ <br> In setting forth Thy love; <br> And raise in death our triumph higher, <br> And sing with all the heavenly choir, <br> That endless song above! <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>3456</p>
