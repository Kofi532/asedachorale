        <p><br>1 LORD of the worlds above, <br> How pleasant and how fair <br> The dwellings of Thy love, <br> Thine earthy temples, are! <br> To thine abode <br> My heart aspires, <br> With warm desires <br> To see my God.<br>2 O happy souls that pray <br> Where God delights to hear! <br> O happy men that pay <br> Their constant service there! <br> They praise Thee still, <br> And happy they <br> Who love the way <br> To Zions hill!<br>3 They go from strength to strength, <br> Through this dark vale of tears, <br> Till each oercomes at length, <br> Till each in heaven appears: <br> O glorious seat! <br> Thou God, our King, <br> Shalt thither bring <br> Our willing feet.<br>4 God is our sun and shield, <br> Our light and our defence; <br> With gifts His hands are filled, <br> We draw our blessings thence: <br> He shall bestow <br> Upon our race <br> His saving grace, <br> And glory too.<br>5 The Lord His people loves; <br> His hand no good withholds <br> From those His heart approves, <br> From holy, humble souls <br> Thrice happy he, <br> O Lord of Hosts, <br> Whose spirit trusts <br> Alone in Thee! <br>  <br> Source: Redemption Hymnal #<br>74</p>
