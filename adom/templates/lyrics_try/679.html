        <p><br>1 PLEASANT are Thy courts above, <br> In the land of light and love; <br> Pleasant are Thy courts below, <br> In this land of sin and woe. <br> Oh, my spirit longs and faints <br> For the converse of Thy saints, <br> For the brightness of Thy face, <br> For Thy fulness, God of grace!<br>2 Happy birds that sing and fly <br> Round Thy altars, O Most High! <br> Happier souls that find a rest <br> In a heavenly FatherÂ’s breast! <br> Like the wandering dove that found <br> No repose on earth around, <br> They can to their ark repair, <br> And enjoy it ever there.<br>3 Happy souls! their praises flow <br> Even in this vale of woe; <br> Waters in the desert rise, <br> Manna feeds them from the skies. <br> On they go from strength to strength, <br> Till they reach Thy throne at length; <br> At Thy feet adoring fall, <br> Who hast led them safe through all.<br>4 Lord, be mine this prize to win: <br> Guide me through a world of sin; <br> Keep me by Thy saving grace; <br> Give me at Thy side a place. <br> Sun and shield alike Thou art; <br> Guide and guard my erring heart: <br> Grace and glory flow from Thee; <br> Shower, oh shower them, Lord, on me! <br>  <br> Source: Redemption Hymnal #<br>100</p>
