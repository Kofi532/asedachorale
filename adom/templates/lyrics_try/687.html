        <p><br><br>1 'Lift up your hearts!' We lift them, Lord, to thee; <br> here at thy feet none other may we see: <br> 'lift up your hearts!' E'en so, with one accord, <br> we lift them up, we lift them to the Lord.<br><br>2 Above the level of the former years, <br> the mire of sin, the slough of guilty fears, <br> the mist of doubt, the blight of love's decay, <br> O Lord of light, lift all our hearts to-day.<br><br>3 Above the swamps of subterfuge and shame, <br> the deeds, the thoughts, that honour may not name, <br> the halting tongue that dares not tell the whole, <br> O Lord of truth, lift every Christian soul.<br><br>4 Lift every gift that thou thyself hast given: <br> low lies the best till lifted up to heaven; <br> low lie the bounding heart, the teeming brain, <br> till, sent from God, they mount to God again.<br><br>5 Then, as the trumpet-call in after years, <br> 'Lift up your hearts!' rings pealing in our ears, <br> still shall those hearts respond with full accord, <br> 'We lift them up, we lift them to the Lord!' <br>  <br> Source: Ancient and Modern: hymns and songs for refreshing worship #<br><br>708</p>
