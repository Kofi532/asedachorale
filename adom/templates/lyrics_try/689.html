        <p><br>1 At even, ere the sun was set, <br> the sick, O Lord, around thee lay; <br> O in what divers pains they met! <br> O with what joy they went away!<br>2 Once more 'tis eventide, and we <br> oppressed with various ills draw near; <br> what if thy form we cannot see? <br> we know and feel that thou art here.<br>3 O Saviour Christ, our woes dispel; <br> for some are sick, and some are sad, <br> and some have never loved thee well, <br> and some have lost the love they had;<br>4 And some have found the world is vain, <br> yet from the world they break not free; <br> and some have friends who give them pain, <br> yet have not sought a friend in thee;<br>5 And none, O Lord, have perfect rest, <br> for none are wholly free from sin; <br> and they who fain would serve thee best <br> are conscious most of wrong within.<br>6 O Saviour Christ, thou too art man; <br> thou hast been troubled, tempted, tried; <br> thy kind but searching glance can scan <br> the very wounds that shame would hide.<br>7 Thy touch has still its ancient power; <br> no word from thee can fruitless fall: <br> Hear, in this solemn evening hour, <br> and in thy mercy heal us all. <br>  <br> Source: Ancient and Modern: hymns and songs for refreshing worship #<br>13</p>
