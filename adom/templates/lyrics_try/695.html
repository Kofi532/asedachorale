<p><b>M.H.B {{ clicked_value }}</b></p>

        <p><br>1. Praise for Thee, Lord, in Zion waits; <br> Prayer shall besiege Thy temple gates; <br> All flesh shall to Thy throne repair, <br> And find through Christ salvation there. <br> <br>2. Our spirits faint; our sins prevail; <br> Leave not our trembling hearts to fail: <br> O Thou that hearest prayer, descend, <br> And still be found the sinnerÂ’s friend. <br> <br>3. How blest Thy saints! how safely led! <br> How surely kept! how richly fed! <br> Savior of all in earth and sea, <br> How happy they who rest in Thee. <br> <br>4. Thy hand sets fast the mighty hills, <br> Thy voice the troubled ocean stills; <br> Evening and morning hymn Thy praise, <br> And earthy Thou bounty wide displays. <br> <br>5. The year is with Thy goodness crowned; <br> Thy clouds drop wealth the world around; <br> Through Thee the deserts laugh and sing, <br> And nature smiles and owns her King. <br> <br>6. Lord, on our souls Thy Spirit pour; <br> The moral waste within restore; <br> O let Thy love our springtide be, <br> And make us all bear fruit to Thee.</p>
