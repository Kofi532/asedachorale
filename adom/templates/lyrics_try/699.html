        <p><br>1 Great is our redeeming Lord, <br> In, power, and truth, and grace; <br> Him, by highest heaven adored, <br> His Church on earth doth praise: <br> In the city of our God, <br> In His holy mount below, <br> Publish, spread His name abroad, <br> And all His greatness show. <br> <br>2 For Thy loving kindness, Lord, <br> We in Thy temple stay; <br> Here Thy faithful love record, <br> Thy saving power display: <br> With Thy name Thy praise is known, <br> Glorious Thy perfections shine; <br> Earths remotest bounds shall own <br> Thy works are all divine. <br> <br>3 See the Gospel Church secure, <br> And founded on a rock; <br> All her promises are sure; <br> Her bulwarks who can shock? <br> Count! her every precious shrine; <br> Tell, to after ages tell, <br> Fortified by power divine, <br> The church can never fail. <br> <br>4 Zions God is all our own, <br> Who on His love rely; <br> We His pardoning love have known, <br> And live to Christ and die: <br> To the new Jerusalem <br> He our faithful guide shall be; <br> Him we claim, and rest in Him, <br> Through all eternity. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>9987</p>
