        <p><br>1 O Heavenly King, look down from above; <br> Assist us to sing thy mercy and love: <br> So sweetly o'erflowing, so plenteous the store, <br> Thou still art bestowing, and giving us more. <br> <br>2 O God of our life, we hallow thy name; <br> Our business and strife is thee to proclaim. <br> Accept our thanksgiving for creating grace; <br> The living, the living shall show forth thy praise. <br> <br>3 Our Father and Lord, almighty art thou; <br> Preserved by thy word, we worship thee now; <br> The bountiful donor of all we enjoy, <br> Our tongues, to thine honour, and lives we employ. <br> <br>4 But O above all thy kindness we praise, <br> From sin and from thrall which saves the lost race; <br> Thy Son thou hast given the world to redeem, <br> And bring us to heaven whose trust is in him. <br> <br>5 Wherefore of thy love we sing and rejoice, <br> With angels above we lift up our voice; <br> Thy love each believer shall gladly adore, <br> For ever and ever, when time is no more. <br>  <br> Source: Hymns and Psalms: a Methodist and ecumenical hymn book #<br>504</p>
