        <p><br>1 All my hope on God is founded; <br> he doth still my trust renew. <br> Me through change and chance he guideth, <br> only good and only true. <br> God unknown, <br> he alone <br> calls my heart to be his own.<br>2 Human pride and earthly glory, <br> sword and crown betray his trust; <br> what with care and toil he buildeth, <br> tower and temple, fall to dust. <br> But God's power, <br> hour by hour, <br> is my temple and my tower.<br>3 God's great goodness aye endureth, <br> deep his wisdom, passing thought: <br> splendour, light, and life attend him, <br> beauty springeth out of naught. <br> Evermore <br> from his store <br> new-born worlds rise and adore.<br>4 Daily doth th' Almighty giver <br> bounteous gifts on us bestow; <br> his desire our soul delighteth, <br> pleasure leads us where we go. <br> Love doth stand <br> at his hand; <br> joy doth wait on his command.<br>5 Still from earth to God eternal <br> sacrifice of praise be done, <br> high above all praises praising <br> for the gift of Christ his Son. <br> Christ doth call <br> one and all: <br> ye who follow shall not fall. <br>  <br> Source: Ancient and Modern: hymns and songs for refreshing worship #<br>584</p>
