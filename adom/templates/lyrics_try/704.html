        <p><br>1 By the holy hills surrounded, <br> On her firm base securely rounded, <br> Stands fast the city of the Lord; <br> None shall rend her, walls asunder; <br> On her men look with fear and wonder; <br> And mark who here keeps watch and ward. <br> He slumbers not, nor sleeps, <br> Who His loved Israel keeps, <br> Hallelunah! <br> Happy the race <br> Who through God's grace <br> Shall have in her their dwelling place! <br> <br>2 Zion's gates Jehovah loveth, <br> And with especial grace approveth; <br> He maketh fast her bolts and bars; <br> Those who dwell in her He blesses, <br> And comforts them in their distresses <br> Who cast on Him their griefs and cares. <br> How wonderful the grace <br> With which He doth embrace <br> All His people! <br> City of God, <br> How sweet the abode <br> On which such blessings are bestowed! <br> <br>3 Taught in thee is a salvation <br> Unknown to every other nation; <br> There great and holy things are heard; <br> In the midst of thee abiding, <br> Enlightening, comforting, and guiding, <br> Thou hast the Spirit and the word; <br> There breathing peace around <br> Is heard the joyful sound, <br> Grace and mercy! <br> How sweet that is <br> Which here speaks peace, <br> There crowns with everlasting bliss. <br> <br>4 Mother thou of every nation <br> Which here hath sought and found salvation, <br> O Zion, yet on earth shalt be: <br> Hark, what shouts the air are rending? <br> What cries to heaven's gates ascending! <br> All our fresh springs shall be in thee. <br> From thee the waters burst, <br> To slake our burning thirst, <br> Hallelujah! <br> From sin and death <br> God's own word saith <br> That He alone delivereth. <br>  <br> Source: The Lutheran Hymnary #<br>80</p>
