        <p><br>1 God is the refuge of His saints, <br> when storms of sharp distress invade; <br> ere we can offer our complaints <br> behold Him present with His aid. <br> <br>2 Let mountains from their seats be hurled <br> down to the deep, and buried there, <br> convulsions shake the solid world, <br> our faith shall never yield to fear. <br> <br>3 Loud may the troubled ocean roar; <br> in sacred peace our souls abide, <br> while every nation, every shore, <br> trembles, and dreads the swelling tide. <br> <br>4 There is a stream, whose gentle flow <br> supplies the city of our God; <br> life, love, and joy, still gliding through, <br> and wat'ring our divine abode. <br> <br>5 That sacred stream, Thy holy Word, <br> our grief allays, our fear controls; <br> sweet peace Thy promises afford, <br> and give new strength to fainting souls. <br> <br>6 Zion enjoys her Monarch's love, <br> secure against a threat'ning hour; <br> nor can her firm foundations move, <br> built on His truth, and armed with pow'r. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God #<br>46B</p>
