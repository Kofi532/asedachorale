        <p><br>1 Glorious things of thee are spoken, <br> Zion, city of our God. <br> He whose Word cannot be broken <br> formed thee for His own abode. <br> On the Rock of Ages founded, <br> what can shake thy sure repose? <br> With salvation's walls surrounded, <br> thou may'st smile at all thy foes. <br> <br>2 See, the streams of living waters, <br> springing from eternal love, <br> well supply thy sons and daughters <br> and all fear of want remove. <br> Who can faint while such a river <br> ever flows their thirst to assuage? <br> Grace, which like the Lord, the Giver, <br> never fails from age to age. <br> <br>3 'Round each habitation hov'ring, <br> see the cloud and fire appear <br> for a glory and a cov'ring, <br> showing that the Lord is near. <br> Thus deriving from their banner <br> light by night and shade by day, <br> safe they feed upon the manna <br> which He gives them on their way. <br> <br>4 Savior, since of Zion's city <br> I through grace a member am, <br> let the world deride or pity, <br> I will glory in Thy name. <br> Fading is the worldling's pleasures, <br> all his boasted pomp and show; <br> solid joys and lasting treasures <br> none but Zion's children know. <br>  <br> Source: Psalms and Hymns to the Living God #<br>416</p>
