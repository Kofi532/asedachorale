        <p><br>1 O THOU not made with hands, <br> Not throned above the skies, <br> Nor walled with shining walls, <br> Nor framed with stones of price, <br> More bright than gold or gem, <br> God's own Jerusalem! <br> <br>2 Where'er the gentle heart <br> Finds courage from above; <br> Where'er the heart forsook <br> Warms with the breath of love; <br> Where faith bids fear depart, <br> City of God, thou art. <br> <br>3 Thou art where'er the proud <br> In humbleness melts down; <br> Where self itself yields up; <br> Where martyrs win their crown; <br> Where faithful souls possess <br> Themselves in perfect peace; <br> <br>4 Where in life's common ways <br> With cheerful feet we go; <br> Where in his steps we tread, <br> Who trod the way of woe; <br> Where he is in the heart, <br> City of God, thou art. <br> <br>5 Not throned above the skies, <br> Nor golden-walled afar, <br> But where Christ's two or three <br> In his name gathered are, <br> Be in the midst of them, <br> God's own Jerusalem. <br>  <br> Source: The New English Hymnal #<br>430</p>
