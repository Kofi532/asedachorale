        <p><br>1 How pleasant, how divinely fair, <br> O LORD of hosts, your dwellings are! <br> With long desire my spirit faints <br> to see the shining hosts of saints. <br> My flesh would rest in you abode; <br> my weary heart cries out for God: <br> "My God! My King! Why should I stay <br> far from the joys of endless day?" <br> <br>2 The sparrow has a place to rest, <br> and for her young provides a nest, <br> but will my God to them alone <br> pour out his mercy from the throne? <br> Blest are the saints who dwell on high <br> around your throne, above the sky; <br> their brightest glories shine above, <br> and all their work is praise and love. <br> <br>3 Great God, attend, while Zion sings <br> the joy that from your presence springs; <br> to spend a day within your courts <br> exceeds a thousand days apart. <br> You are our sun, you bless our day; <br> and you our shield, to guard our way <br> from all assaults of hell and sin, <br> from foes without and fears within. <br> <br>4 All needed grace you will bestow, <br> and crown that grace with glory too; <br> you give all things, and you withhold <br> no heav'nly good from upright souls. <br> O God our King, whose sov'reign sway <br> the glorious hosts of heav'n obey, <br> display your grace, exert your pow'r, <br> till all on earth your name adore. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Christian Worship: Psalter #<br>84C</p>
