        <p><br>1 He wants not friends that hath thy love, <br> and may converse and walk with thee, <br> and with thy saints here and above, <br> with whom for ever I must be. <br> <br>2 In the blest fellowship of saints <br> is wisdom, safety, and delight; <br> and when my heart declines and faints, <br> its raisèd by their heat and light. <br> <br>3 As for my friends, they are not lost; <br> the several vessels of thy fleet, <br> though parted now, by tempests tossed, <br> shall safely in the haven meet. <br> <br>4 Still we are centred all in thee, <br> members, though distant, of one Head; <br> in the same family we be, <br> by the same faith and spirit led. <br> <br>5 Before thy throne we daily meet <br> as joint-petitioners to thee; <br> in spirit we each other greet, <br> and shall again each other see. <br> <br>6 The heavenly hosts, world without end, <br> shall be my company above; <br> and thou, my best and surest Friend, <br> who shall divide me from thy love? <br>  <br> Source: Common Praise: A new edition of Hymns Ancient and Modern #<br>459a</p>
