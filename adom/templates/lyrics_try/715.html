        <p><br>1 For the might of Your arm we bless You, <br> our God, our fathers God; <br> You have kept Your pilgrim people <br> by the strength of Your staff and rod; <br> You have called us to the journey <br> which faithless feet neer trod: <br> for the might of Your arm we bless You, <br> our God, our fathers God. <br> <br>2 For the love of Christ constraining <br> that bound their hearts as one; <br> for the faith in truth and freedom <br> in which their work was done; <br> for the peace of Gods evangel <br> wherewith their feet were shod: <br> for the might of Your arm we bless You, <br> our God, our fathers God. <br> <br>3 We are watchers of a beacon <br> whose light must never die; <br> we are guardians of an altar <br> that shows You ever nigh; <br> we are children of the ransomed <br> who sleep beneath the sod: <br> for the might of Your arm we bless You, <br> our God, our fathers God. <br> <br>4 May the shadow of Your presence <br> around our camp be spread; <br> baptise us with the courage <br> with which You blessed our dead; <br> O keep us in the pathway <br> their saintly feet have trod: <br> for the might of Your arm we bless You, <br> our God, our fathers God. <br>  <br> Source: The Irish Presbyterian Hymbook #<br>80</p>
