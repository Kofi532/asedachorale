        <p><br>1 Thou God of truth and love, <br> We seek thy perfect way, <br> Ready thy choice t' approve, <br> Thy providence t' obey, <br> Enter into thy wise design, <br> And sweetly lose our will in thine. <br> <br>2 Why hast thou cast our lot <br> In the same age and place? <br> And why together brought <br> To see each other's face; <br> To join with softest sympathy, <br> And mix our friendly souls in thee? <br> <br>3 Didst thou not make us one, <br> That we might one remain, <br> Together travel on, <br> And bear each other's pain, <br> Till all thy utmost goodness prove, <br> And rise renew'd in perfect love? <br> <br>4 Surely thou didst unite <br> Our kindred spirits here, <br> That all hereafter might <br> Before thy throne appear; <br> Meet at the marriage of the Lamb, <br> And all thy glorious love proclaim. <br> <br>5 Then let us ever bear <br> The blessed end in view, <br> And join with mutual care, <br> To fight our passage through; <br> And kindly help each other on, <br> Till all receive thy starry crown. <br> <br>6 O may thy Spirit seal <br> Our souls unto that day! <br> With all thy fulness fill, <br> And then transport away! <br> Away to our eternal rest, <br> Away to our Redeemer's breast! <br>  <br> Source: A Pocket Hymn Book: designed as a constant companion for the pious, collected from various authors (<br>9th ed.) #CXCII</p>
