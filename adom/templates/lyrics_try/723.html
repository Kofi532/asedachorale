        <p><br><br>1. Lift up your hearts to things above, <br> Ye followers of the Lamb, <br> And join with us to praise His love, <br> And glorify His name. <br> <br><br>2. To Jesus name give thanks and sing, <br> Whose mercies never end: <br> Rejoice! rejoice! the Lord is king; <br> The King is now our friend! <br> <br><br>3. We, for His sake, count all things loss; <br> On earthly good look down; <br> And joyfully sustain the cross, <br> Till we receive the crown. <br> <br><br>4. O let us stir each other up, <br> Our faith by works to approve, <br> By holy, purifying hope, <br> And the sweet task of love! <br> <br><br>5. Love us, though far in flesh disjoined, <br> Ye lovers of the Lamb; <br> And ever bear us on your mind, <br> Who think and speak the same: <br> <br><br>6. You on our minds we ever bear, <br> Whoeer to Jesus bow; <br> Stretch out the arms of faith and prayer, <br> And lo! we reach you now. <br> <br><br>7. Surely we now your souls embrace, <br> With you we now appear <br> Present before the throne of grace, <br> And you, and Christ, are here. <br> <br><br>8. The blessings all on you be shed, <br> Which God in Christ imparts; <br> We pray the Spirit of our Head <br> Into your faithful hearts. <br> <br><br>9. Mercy and peace your portion be, <br> To carnal minds unknown, <br> The hidden manna, and the tree <br> Of life, and the white stone. <br> <br><br>10. Live till the Lord in glory come, <br> And wait His Heaven to share: <br> Our Savior now prepares our home: <br> Go onwell meet you there. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br><br>4086</p>
