        <p><br>1 Savior, when in dust to you <br> low we bow in homage due, <br> when, repentant, to the skies <br> scarce we lift our weeping eyes, <br> O, by all your pains and woe <br> suffered once for us below, <br> bending from your throne on high, <br> hear our penitential cry! <br> <br>2 By your helpless infant years, <br> by your life of want and tears, <br> by your days of deep distress <br> in the savage wilderness, <br> by the dread, mysterious hour <br> of th'insulting tempter's pow'r, <br> turn, O turn a fav'ring eye, <br> hear our penitential cry! <br> <br>3 By your hour of dire despair, <br> by your agony of prayer, <br> by the cross, the nail, the thorn, <br> piercing spear, and torturing scorn, <br> by the gloom that veiled the skies <br> o'er the dreadful sacrifice, <br> listen to our humble sigh, <br> hear our penitential cry! <br> <br>4 By your deep expiring groan, <br> by the sad sepulchral stone, <br> by the vault whose dark abode <br> held in vain the rising God, <br> O, from earth to heav'n restored, <br> mighty, re-ascended Lord, <br> bending from your throne on high, <br> hear our penitential cry! <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Christian Worship: Hymnal #<br>393</p>
