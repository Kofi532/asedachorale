        <p><br>1 Jesus, with thy church abide; <br> be her Savior, Lord, and Guide, <br> while on earth her faith is tried: <br> we beseech thee, hear us. <br> <br>2 Keep her life and doctrine pure; <br> grant her patience to endure, <br> trusting in thy promise sure: <br> we beseech thee, hear us. <br> <br>3 May she one in doctrine be, <br> one in truth and charity, <br> winning all to faith in thee: <br> we beseech thee, hear us. <br> <br>4 May she guide the poor and blind, <br> seek the lost until she find, <br> and the broken-hearted bind: <br> we beseech thee, hear us. <br> <br>5 Judge her not for work undone, <br> judge her not for fields unwon, <br> bless her work in thee begun: <br> we beseech thee, hear us. <br> <br>6 Save her love from growing cold, <br> make her watchmen strong and bold, <br> fence her round, thy peaceful fold: <br> we beseech thee, hear us. <br> <br>7 May her lamp of truth be bright, <br> bid her bear aloft its light <br> through the realms of heathen night: <br> we beseech thee, hear us. <br> <br>8 Arm her soldiers with the cross, <br> brave to suffer toil or loss, <br> counting earthly gain but dross: <br> we beseech thee, hear us. <br> <br>9 May she holy triumphs win, <br> overthrow the hosts of sin, <br> gather all the nations in: <br> we beseech thee, hear us. <br>  <br> Source: Trinity Psalter Hymnal #<br>406</p>
