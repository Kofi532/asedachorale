        <p><br>1 O God of mercy, God of might, <br> In love and pity infinite, <br> Teach us, as ever in Thy sight, <br> To live our lives in Thee. <br> <br>2 And Thou, who cam'st on earth to die <br> That our lost world might live thereby, <br> O hear us; for to Thee we cry, <br> In hope, O Lord, to Thee. <br> <br>3 Teach us the lesson Thou hast taught: <br> To feel for those Thy blood hath bought, <br> That ev'ry word and deed and thought <br> May work a work for Thee. <br> <br>4 All are redeemed, both far and wide, <br> Since Thou, O Lord, for all hast died. <br> Grant us the will and grace provide <br> To love them all in Thee! <br> <br>5 In sickness, sorrow, want, or care, <br> May we each other's burdens share; <br> May we, where help is needed, there <br> Give help as unto Thee! <br> <br>6 And may Thy Holy Spirit move <br> All those who live to live in love <br> Till Thou shalt greet in heav'n above <br> All those who live in Thee. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Lutheran Service Book #<br>852</p>
