        <p><br>1 O Christ, our God, who with Thine own hast been, <br> Our spirits cleave to Thee, the Friend unseen. <br> <br>2 Vouchsafe that all who on Thy bounty feed <br> May heed Thy love, and prize Thy gifts indeed. <br> <br>3 Make every heart that is Thy dwelling-place <br> A watered garden filled with fruits of grace. <br> <br>4 Each holy purpose help us to fulfil; <br> Increase our faith to feed upon Thee still. <br> <br>5 Illuminate our minds, that we may see <br> In all around us holy signs of Thee. <br> <br>6 And may such witness in our lives appear, <br> That all may know Thou hast been with us here. <br> <br>7 O grant us peace, that by Thy peace possessed, <br> Thy life within us we may manifest. <br> <br>8 So shall we pass our days in holy fear, <br> In joyful consciousness that Thou art near. <br> <br>9 So shalt Thou be for ever, loving Lord, <br> Our Shield and our exceeding great Reward. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Methodist Hymn and Tune Book: official hymn book of the Methodist Church #<br>463</p>
