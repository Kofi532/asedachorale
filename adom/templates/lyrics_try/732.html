        <p><br>1 Sweetly the holy hymn <br> Breaks on the morning air; <br> Before the world with smoke is dim, <br> We meet to offer prayer. <br> <br>2 While flow'rs are wet with dews, <br> Dew of our souls, descend; <br> Ere yet the sun the day renews, <br> O Lord, Thy Spirit send. <br> <br>3 Upon the battlefield, <br> Before the fight begins, <br> We seek, O Lord, Thy shelt'ring shield, <br> To guard us from our sins. <br> <br>4 On the lone mountain side, <br> Before the morning's light, <br> The Man of sorrows wept and cried, <br> And rose refreshed with might. <br> <br>5 Oh, hear us then, for we <br> Are very weak and frail, <br> We make the Saviour's name our plea, <br> And surely must prevail. <br>  <br> Source: Christ in Song: for all religious services nearly one thousand best gospel hymns, new and old with responsive scripture readings (Rev. and Enl.) #<br>460</p>
