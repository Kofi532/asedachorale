        <p><br>1 Father of all, to Thee, <br> With loving hearts we pray, <br> Through Him, in mercy given, <br> The Life, the Truth, the Way; <br> From heaven, Thy throne, in mercy shed <br> Thy blessings on each bended head. <br> <br>2 Father of all, to Thee, <br> Our contrite hearts we raise, <br> Unstrung by sin and pain, <br> Long voiceless in Thy praise; <br> Breathe Thou the silent chords along, <br> Until they tremble into song. <br> <br>3 Father of all, to Thee, <br> we breathe unuttered fears, <br> Deep-hidden in our souls, <br> That have no voice but tears; <br> Take Thou our hand, and through the wild <br> Lead gently on, each trembling child. <br> <br>4 Father of all, may we <br> In praise our tongues employ, <br> When gladness fills the soul <br> With deep and hallowed joy; <br> In storm and calm give us to see <br> The path of peace, which leads to Thee. <br> Amen. <br> The Hymnal: Published by the authority of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A., <br>1895</p>
