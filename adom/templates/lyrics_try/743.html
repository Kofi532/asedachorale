        <p><br>1 Not for our sins alone <br> thy mercy, Lord, we sue; <br> let fall thy pitying glance <br> on our devotions too, <br> what we have done for thee, <br> and what we think to do. <br> <br>2 The holiest hours we spend <br> in prayer upon our knees, <br> the times when most we deem <br> our songs of praise will please, <br> thou searcher of all hearts, <br> forgiveness pour on these. <br> <br>3 And all the gifts we bring, <br> and all the vows we make, <br> and all the acts of love <br> We plan for thy dear sake, <br> into thy pard'ning thought, <br> O God in mercy take. <br> <br>4 And most, when we, thy flock, <br> before thine altar bend, <br> and strange, bewild'ring thoughts <br> with those sweet moments blend, <br> by him whose death we plead, <br> good Lord, thy help extend. <br> <br>5 Bow down thine ear and hear! <br> Open thine eyes and see. <br> Our very love is shame, <br> and we must comet <br> to make it of tgrace <br> what thou wouldst have it be. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Rejoice in the Lord #<br>506</p>
