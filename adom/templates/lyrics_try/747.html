        <p><br><br>1 I am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice, <br> And it told Thy love to me; <br> But I long to rise in the arms of faith, <br> And be closer drawn to Thee. <br> Refrain: <br> Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord, <br> To the cross where Thou hast died; <br> Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord, <br> To Thy precious, bleeding side. <br> <br><br>2 Consecrate me now to Thy service, Lord, <br> By the powÂ’r of grace divine; <br> Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope, <br> And my will be lost in Thine. [Refrain] <br> <br><br>3 Oh, the pure delight of a single hour <br> That before Thy throne I spend, <br> When I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God, <br> I commune as friend with friend! [Refrain] <br> <br><br>4 There are depths of love that I cannot know <br> Till I cross the narrow sea; <br> There are heights of joy that I may not reach <br> Till I rest in peace with Thee. [Refrain] <br>  <br> Source: One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism: an African American ecumenical hymnal #<br><br>178</p>
