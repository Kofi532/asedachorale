        <p><br>1. O God! how often hath Thine ear <br> To me in willing mercy bowed! <br> While worshipping Thine altar near, <br> Lowly I wept, and strongly vowed; <br> But ah! the feebleness of man! <br> Have I not vowed and wept in vain? <br> <br>2. Return, O Lord of hosts, return! <br> Behold Thy servant in distress; <br> My faithlessness again I mourn, <br> Again forgive my faithlessness; <br> And to Thine arms my spirit take <br> And bless me for the Saviors sake. <br> <br>3. This day the covenant I sign, <br> The bond of sure and promised peace, <br> Nor can I doubt its power divine, <br> Since sealed with Jesus blood it is; <br> That blood I take, that blood alone, <br> And make the covenant peace mine own. <br> <br>4. But, that my faith no more may know <br> Or change, or interval, or end, <br> Help me in all Thy paths to go, <br> And now, as eer, my voice attend, <br> And gladden me with answers mild, <br> And dwell, O Father, with Thy child! <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>4851</p>
