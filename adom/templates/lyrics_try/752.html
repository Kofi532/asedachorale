        <p><br>1 Dearest Jesus, we are here, <br> gladly your command obeying; <br> with this child we now draw near <br> in response to your own saying <br> that to you it shall be given <br> as a child and heir of heaven. <br> <br>2 Lord, your Word is clear and plain, <br> and we would obey it duly: <br> "He who is not born again, <br> heart and life renewing truly, <br> born of water and the Spirit, <br> can my kingdom not inherit." <br> <br>3 Therefore we have come to you, <br> in our arms this infant bearing. <br> Shine your heav'nly light anewÂ— <br> let this child, your mercy sharing, <br> in your arms be shielded ever, <br> yours on earth and yours forever. <br> <br>4 Gracious Head, your member own; <br> Shepherd, take your lamb and feed it; <br> Prince of Peace, make here your throne; <br> Way of life, to heaven lead it. <br> Precious Vine, let nothing sever <br> from your side this branch forever. <br> <br>5 Now into your heart we pour <br> prayers that from our hearts proceeded. <br> Our petitions heav'nward soar; <br> may our warm desires be heeded! <br> Write the name we now have given; <br> write it in the book of heaven! <br>  <br> Source: Christian Worship: Hymnal #<br>648</p>
