        <p><br>1 O Father, all-creating, <br> Whose wisdom, love, and pow'r <br> First bound two lives together <br> In Eden's primal hour, <br> To these who come before you, <br> Your earliest gifts renew: <br> A home by you made happy, <br> A love by you kept true. <br> <br>2 O Savior, guest in Cana <br> Of old in Galilee, <br> May these who ask your blessing <br> Your loving presence see. <br> Their store of earthly gladness <br> Transform to heav'nly wine, <br> And teach them, in the testing, <br> To know your gift divine. <br> <br>3 O Spirit of the Father, <br> Breathe on them from above, <br> So mighty in your pureness, <br> So tender in your love; <br> That, guarded by your presence, <br> From sin and strife kept free, <br> Their hearts may seek your guidance, <br> And love you faithfully. <br> <br>4 Unless you build it, Father, <br> The house is built in vain; <br> Unless you bless it, Savior, <br> The joy will turn to pain; <br> But none can break the union <br> Of hearts in you made one; <br> The love your Spirit blesses <br> Is endless love begun. <br>  <br> Source: Journeysongs (<br>3rd ed.) #<br>544</p>
