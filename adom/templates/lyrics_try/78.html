        <p><br>1 How shall I sing that majesty <br> which angels do admire? <br> Let dust in dust and silence lie; <br> sing, sing, ye heavenly choir. <br> Thousands of thousands stand around <br> thy throne, O God most high; <br> ten thousand times ten thousand sound <br> thy praise; but who am I?<br>2 Thy brightness unto them appears, <br> whilst I thy footsteps trace; <br> a sound of God comes to my ears, <br> but they behold thy face. <br> They sing, because thou art their Sun; <br> Lord, send a beam on me; <br> for where heaven is but once begun <br> there alleluias be.<br>3 Enlighten with faith's light my heart, <br> inflame it with love's fire; <br> then shall I sing and bear a part <br> with that celestial choir. <br> I shall, I fear, be dark and cold, <br> with all my fire and light; <br> yet when thou dost accept their gold, <br> Lord, treasure up my mite.<br>4 How great a being, Lord, is thine, <br> which doth all beings keep! <br> Thy knowledge is the only line <br> to sound so vast a deep. <br> Thou art a sea without a shore, <br> a sun without a sphere; <br> thy time is now and evermore, <br> thy place is everywhere. <br>  <br> Source: Ancient and Modern: hymns and songs for refreshing worship #<br>663</p>
