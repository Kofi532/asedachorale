        <p><br>1 Disposer supreme, and Judge of the earth, <br> who choosest for thine the meek and the poor; <br> to frail earthen vessels, and things of no worth, <br> entrusting thy riches which ay shall endure;<br>2 Those vessels soon fail, though full of thy light, <br> and at thy decree are broken and gone; <br> thence brightly appeareth thy truth in its might, <br> as through the clouds riven the lightnings have shone.<br>3 Like clouds are they borne to do thy great will, <br> and swift as the winds about the world go: <br> the Word with his wisdom their spirits doth fill; <br> they thunder, they lighten, the waters o'erflow.<br>4 Their sound goeth forth, 'Christ Jesus the Lord!' <br> then Satan doth fear, his citadels fall; <br> as when the dread trumpets went forth at thy word, <br> and one long blast shattered the Canaanite's wall.<br>5 O loud be their trump, and stirring their sound, <br> to rouse us, O Lord, from slumber of sin: <br> the lights thou hast kindled in darkness around, <br> O may they awaken our spirits within.<br>6 All honour and praise, dominion and might, <br> to God, Three in One, eternally be, <br> who round us hath shed his own marvellous light, <br> and called us from darkness his glory to see. <br>  <br> Source: Ancient and Modern: hymns and songs for refreshing worship #<br>295</p>
