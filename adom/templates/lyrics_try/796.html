        <p><br>1 LORD, Thy ransomed Church is waking <br> Out of slumber far and near, <br> Knowing that the morn is breaking <br> When the Bridegroom shall appear: <br> Waking up to claim the treasure <br> With Thy precious life-blood bought, <br> And to trust in fuller measure <br> All Thy wondrous death hath wrought.<br>2 Praise to Thee for this glad shower, <br> Precious drops of latter rain; <br> Praise, that by Thy Spirits power <br> Thou hast quickened us again; <br> That Thy Gospel's priceless treasure <br> Now is borne from land to land, <br> And that all the Fathers pleasure <br> Prospers in Thy hand.<br>3 Praise to Thee for saved ones yearning <br> Oer the lost and wandering throng; <br> Praise for voices daily learning <br> To upraise the glad new song: <br> Praise to Thee for sick ones hasting <br> Now to touch Thy garments hem! <br> Praise for souls believingtasting <br> All Thy love has won for them.<br>4 Set on fire our hearts devotion <br> With the love of Thy dear name; <br> Till oer every land and ocean <br> Lips and lives Thy Cross proclaim, <br> Fix our eyes on Thy returning, <br> Keeping watch till Thou shalt come; <br> Loins well girt, lamps brightly burning; <br> Then, Lord, take Thy servants home. <br>  <br> Source: Redemption Hymnal #<br>233</p>
