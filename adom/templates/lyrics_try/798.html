        <p><br>1 Far round the world thy children sing their song; <br> From east and west their voices sweetly blend, <br> Praising the Lord, in whom young lives are strong, <br> Jesus our Guide, our Hero, and our Friend. <br> <br>2 Where thy wide ocean, wave on rolling wave, <br> Beats thro' the ages, on each island shore, <br> They praise their Lord, whose hand alone can save, <br> Whose sea of love surrounds them evermore. <br> <br>3 Thy sun-kissed children on earth's spreading plain, <br> Where Asia's rivers water all the land, <br> Sing, as they watch thy fields of glowing grain, <br> Praise to the Lord who feeds them with his hand. <br> <br>4 Still there are lands where none have seen thy face, <br> Children whose hearts have never shared thy joy; <br> Yet thou wouldst pour on these thy radiant grace, <br> Give thy glad strength to every girl and boy. <br> <br>5 All round the world let children sing thy song: <br> From east and west their voices sweetly blend, <br> Praising the Lord in whom young lives are strong, <br> Jesus our Guide, our Hero, and our Friend. <br> Amen. <br>  <br> Source: The Hymnal for Boys and Girls #<br>8</p>
