        <p><br><br>1 PRAISE ye the Lord! 'Tis good to raise <br> Your hearts and voices in His praise: <br> His nature and His works invite <br> To make this duty our delight.<br><br>2 He formed the stars, those heavenly flames, <br> He counts their numbers, calls their names; <br> His wisdom's vast, and knows no bound, <br> A deep where all our thoughts are drowned.<br><br>3 Sing to the Lord! Exalt Him high, <br> Who spreads His clouds along the sky; <br> There He prepares the fruitful rain, <br> Nor lets the drops descend in vain.<br><br>4 He makes the grass the hills adorn, <br> And clothes the smiling fields with corn; <br> The beasts with food His hands supply, <br> And the young ravens when they cry.<br><br>5 What is the creature's skill or force? <br> The sprightly man, or warlike horse? <br> The piercing wit, the active limb? <br> All are too mean delights for Him.<br><br>6 But saints are lovely in His sight, <br> He views His children with delight; <br> He sees their hope, He knows their fear, <br> And looks, and loves His image there. <br>  <br> Source: Redemption Hymnal #<br><br>19</p>
