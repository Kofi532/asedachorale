        <p><br>1 Stand up, stand up for Jesus <br> ye soldiers of the cross; <br> lift high his royal banner, <br> it must not suffer loss. <br> From vict'ry unto vict'ry <br> his army he shall lead <br> till ev'ry foe is vanquished <br> and Christ is Lord indeed. <br> <br>2 Stand up, stand up for Jesus, <br> the trumpet call obey; <br> forth to the mighty conflict <br> in this his glorious day. <br> Ye that are men now serve him <br> against unnumbered foes; <br> let courage rise with danger <br> and strength to strength oppose. <br> <br>3 Stand up, stand up for Jesus, <br> stand in his strength alone; <br> the arm of flesh will fail you, <br> ye dare not trust your own. <br> Put on the gospel armor, <br> each piece put on with prayer; <br> where duty calls or danger, <br> be never wanting there. <br> <br>4 Stand up, stand up for Jesus, <br> the strife will not be long; <br> this day the noise of battle, <br> the next, the victor's song. <br> To him that overcometh <br> a crown of life shall be; <br> he with the King of glory <br> shall reign eternally. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Christian Worship: Hymnal #<br>872</p>
