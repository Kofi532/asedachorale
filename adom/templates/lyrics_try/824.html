        <p><br>1. Come, let us join our friends above <br> who have obtained the prize, <br> and on the eagle wings of love <br> to joys celestial rise. <br> Let saints on earth unite to sing <br> with those to glory gone, <br> for all the servants of our King <br> in earth and heaven are one. <br> <br>2. One family we dwell in him, <br> one church above, beneath, <br> though now divided by the stream, <br> the narrow stream of death; <br> one army of the living God, <br> to his command we bow; <br> part of his host have crossed the flood, <br> and part are crossing now. <br> <br>3. Ten thousand to their endless home <br> this solemn moment fly, <br> and we are to the margin come, <br> and we expect to die. <br> E'en now by faith we join our hands <br> with those that went before, <br> and greet the blood-besprinkled bands <br> on the eternal shore. <br> <br>4. Our spirits too shall quickly join, <br> like theirs with glory crowned, <br> and shout to see our Captain's sign, <br> to hear his trumpet sound. <br> O that we now might grasp our Guide! <br> O that the word were given! <br> Come, Lord of Hosts, the waves divide, <br> and land us all in heaven. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: The United Methodist Hymnal #<br>709</p>
