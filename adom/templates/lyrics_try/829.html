        <p><br>1 HARK! the song of jubilee, <br> Loud as mighty thunders roar, <br> Or the fulness of the sea <br> When it breaks upon the shore: <br> Hallelujah! for the Lord <br> God omnipotent shall reign : <br> Hallelujah! let the word <br> Echo round the earth and main.<br>2 Hallelujah! hark! the sound <br> From the depths unto the skies. <br> Wakes above, beneath, around, <br> All creations harmonies; <br> See Jehovahs banner furled, <br> Sheathed His sword; He speakstis done, <br> And the kingdoms of this world <br> Are the kingdom of His Son.He shall reign from pole to pole <br> With illimitable sway; <br> He shall reign when like a scroll <br> Yonder heavens have passed away <br> Then the end; beneath His rod <br> Mans last enemy shall fall; <br> Hallelujah! Christ in God, <br> God in Christ is All in all! <br>  <br> Source: Redemption Hymnal #<br>14</p>
