        <p><br>1 Hark! The sound of holy voices, <br> chanting at the crystal sea: <br> alleluia, alleluia, <br> alleluia, Lord, to thee: <br> multitude, which none can number, <br> like the stars in glory stands, <br> clothed in white apparel, holding <br> palms of victory in their hands. <br> <br>2 Patriarch and holy prophet, <br> who prepared the way of Christ, <br> king, apostle, saint, confessor, <br> martyr and evangelist, <br> saintly maiden, godly matron, <br> widows who have watched to prayer, <br> joined in holy concert, singing <br> to the Lord of all, are there. <br> <br>3 They have come from tribulation, <br> and have washed their robes in blood, <br> washed them in the blood of Jesus; <br> tried they were, and firm they stood; <br> gladly, Lord, with thee they suffered; <br> gladly, Lord, with thee they died, <br> and by death to life immortal <br> they were born, and glorified. <br> <br>4 Now they reign in heavenly glory, <br> now they walk in golden light, <br> now they drink, as from a river, <br> holy bliss and infinite; <br> love and peace they taste for ever, <br> and all truth and knowledge see <br> in the beatific vision <br> of the bless√®d Trinity. <br> <br>5 God of God, the One-begotten, <br> Light of Light, Emmanuel, <br> in whose Body joined together <br> all the saints for ever dwell; <br> pour upon us of thy fullness, <br> that we may for evermore <br> God the Father, God the Son, and <br> God the Holy Ghost adore. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>827</p>
