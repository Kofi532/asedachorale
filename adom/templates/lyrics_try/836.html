        <p><br>1 Hosanna, loud hosanna <br> the little children sang; <br> through pillared court and temple <br> the lovely anthem rang. <br> To Jesus, who had blessed them, <br> close folded to his breast, <br> the children sang their praises, <br> the simplest and the best. <br> <br>2 From Olivet they followed <br> mid an exultant crowd, <br> the victory palm branch waving, <br> and chanting clear and loud. <br> The Lord of earth and heaven <br> rode on in lowly state, <br> nor scorned that little children <br> should on his bidding wait. <br> <br>3 "Hosanna in the highest!" <br> That ancient song we sing, <br> for Christ is our Redeemer, <br> the Lord of heaven, our King. <br> O may we ever praise him <br> with heart and life and voice, <br> and in his blissful presence <br> eternally rejoice. <br> Psalter Hymnal</p>
