        <p><br>1 Gentle Jesus, meek and mild, <br> look upon a little child, <br> pity my simplicity, <br> suffer me to come to thee. <br> <br>2 Fain I would to thee be brought; <br> gracious Lord, forbid it not; <br> in the kingdom of thy grace <br> give a little child a place. <br> <br>3 Fain I would be as thou art; <br> give me thy obedient heart; <br> thou art pitiful and kind; <br> let me have thy loving mind. <br> <br>4 Let me above all fulfill <br> God my heavenly FatherÂ’s will; <br> never his good Spirit grieve; <br> only to his glory live. <br> <br>5 Lamb of God, I look to thee; <br> thou shalt my example be; <br> thou art gentle, meek and mild; <br> thou wast once a little child. <br> <br>6 Thou didst live to God alone; <br> thou didst never seek thine own; <br> thou thyself didst never please: <br> God was all thy happiness. <br> <br>7 Loving Jesus, gentle Lamb, <br> in thy gracious hands I am; <br> make me, Saviour, what thou art, <br> live thyself within my heart. <br> <br>8 I shall then show forth thy praise, <br> serve thee all my happy days; <br> then the world shall always see <br> Christ, the holy Child, in me. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>646</p>
