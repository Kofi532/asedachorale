        <p><br>1 I love to think, though I am young, <br> My Saviour was a child; <br> That Jesus walked this earth along, <br> With feet all undefiled. <br> <br>2 He kept His Father's word of truth, <br> As I am taught to do; <br> And while He walked the paths of youth, <br> He walked in wisdom too. <br> <br>3 I love to think that He who spake, <br> And made the blind to see, <br> And called the sleeping dead to wake, <br> Was once a child like me. <br> <br>4 That He who wore the thorny crown, <br> And tasted death's despair, <br> Had a kind mother like my own, <br> And knew her love and care. <br> <br>5 I know 'twas all for love of me <br> That He became a child, <br> And left the heavens, so fair to see, <br> And trod earth's pathway wild. <br> <br>5 Then, Saviour, who wast once a child, <br> A child may come to Thee; <br> And oh! in all Thy mercy mild, <br> Dear Saviour, come to me. <br> Amen. <br>  <br> Source: Voices of Praise: for school and church and home #<br>265</p>
