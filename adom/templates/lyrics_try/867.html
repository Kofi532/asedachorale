        <p><br>1 Day by day we magnify Thee, <br> When our hymns in school we raise; <br> Daily work begun and ended, <br> With the daily voice of praise. <br> <br>2 Day by day we magnify thee <br> When as each new day is born, <br> On our knees at home we bless Thee <br> For the mercies of the morn. <br> <br>3 Day by day we magnify Thee <br> In our hymns before we sleep; <br> Angels hear them, watching by us, <br> Christ's dear lambs all night to keep. <br> <br>4 Day by day we magnify Thee <br> Not in words of praise alone; <br> Truthful lips and meek obedience <br> Show Thy glory in Thine own. <br> <br>5 Day by day we magnify Thee <br> When, for Jesus' sake, we try, <br> Every wrong to bear with patience, <br> Every sin to mortify. <br> <br>6 Day by day we magnify Thee <br> Till our days on earth shall cease, <br> Till we rest from these our labours, <br> Waiting for Thy Day in peace! <br> <br>7 Then, on that eternal morning, <br> With Thy great redeemed host, <br> May we fully magnify Thee <br> Father, Son and Holy Ghost! <br>  <br> Source: The Church Hymnal: containing hymns approved and set forth by the general conventions of <br>1892 and <br>1916; together with hymns for the use of guilds and brotherhoods, and for special occasions (Rev. ed) #<br>636</p>
