        <p><br>1 O happy home, where Thou art loved the dearest, <br> Thou loving Friend, and Saviour of our race, <br> And where among the guests there never cometh <br> One who can hold such high and honored place! <br> <br>2 O happy home, where each one serves Thee, lowly, <br> Whatever his appointed work may be, <br> Till every common task seems great and holy, <br> When it is done, O Lord, as unto thee! <br> <br>3 O happy home, where Thou art not forgotten <br> When joy is overflowing, full and free; <br> O happy home, where every wounded spirit <br> Is brought, Physician, Comforter, to TheeÂ—- <br> <br>4 Until at last, when earth's day's work is ended, <br> All meet Thee in the blessed home above, <br> From whence Thou camest, where Thou hast ascended, <br> Thy everlasting home of peace and love! <br> Amen. <br>  <br> Source: Worship and Service Hymnal: For Church, School, and Home #<br>471</p>
