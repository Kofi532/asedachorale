        <p><br>1 How do Thy mercies close me round! <br> For ever be Thy name adored; <br> I blush in all things to abound; <br> The servant is above his Lord. <br> <br>2 Inured to poverty and pain, <br> A suffering life my Master led; <br> The Son of God, the Son of Man, <br> He had not where to lay His head. <br> <br>3 But lo! a place He hath prepared <br> For me, whom watchful angels keep <br> Yea, He Himself becomes my guard; <br> He smooths my bed, and gives me sleep. <br> <br>4 Jesus protects; my fears, be gone; <br> What can the Rock of ages move? <br> Safe in Thine arms I lay me down, <br> Thine everlasting arms of love. <br> <br>5 While Thou art intimately nigh, <br> Who, who shall violate my rest? <br> Sin, earth, and hell I now defy; <br> I lean upon my Saviour's breast. <br> <br>6 I rest beneath the Almighty's shade; <br> My griefs expire, my troubles cease; <br> Thou, Lord, on whom my soul is stayed, <br> Wilt keep me still in perfect peace. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Methodist Hymn and Tune Book: official hymn book of the Methodist Church #<br>212</p>
