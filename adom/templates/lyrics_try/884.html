        <p><br>1 Before thy throne, O God, we kneel: <br> give us a conscience quick to feel, <br> a ready mind to understand <br> the meaning of thy chastening hand; <br> whate'er the pain and shame may be, <br> bring us, O Father, nearer thee. <br> <br>2 Search out our hearts and make us true; <br> help us to give to all their due. <br> From love of pleasure, lust of gold, <br> from sins which make the heart grow cold, <br> wean us and train us with thy rod; <br> teach us to know our faults, O God. <br> <br>3 For sins of heedless word and deed, <br> for pride ambitious to succeed, <br> for crafty trade and subtle snare <br> to catch the simple unaware, <br> for lives bereft of purpose high, <br> forgive, forgive, O Lord, we cry. <br> <br>4 Let the fierce fires which burn and try, <br> our inmost spirits purify: <br> consume the ill; purge out the shame; <br> O God, be with us in the flame; <br> a newborn people may we rise, <br> more pure, more true, more nobly wise. <br>  <br> Source: The Hymnal <br>1982: according to the use of the Episcopal Church #<br>574</p>
