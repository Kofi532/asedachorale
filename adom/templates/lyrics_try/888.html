        <p><br>1. O King of kings, O Lord of hosts, <br> whose throne is lifted high <br> Above the nations of the earth, <br> the armies of the sky, <br> The spirits of perfected saints <br> may give their nobler songs <br> And we, Thy children, worship Thee, <br> to whom all praise belongs. <br> <br>2. Thy hand has hid within our fields <br> treasures of countless worth; <br> The light, the suns of other years, <br> shine from the depths of earth; <br> The very dust, inbreathed by Thee, <br> the clods all cold and dead, <br> Wake into beauty and to life, <br> to give Thy children bread. <br> <br>3. Thou who hast sown the sky with stars, <br> and set Thy thoughts in gold, <br> Hast crowned our nations life, <br> and ours, with blessings manifold; <br> Thy mercies have been numberless; <br> Thy love, Thy grace, Thy care, <br> Were wider than our utmost need, <br> and higher than our prayer. <br> <br>4. O King of kings, O Lord of hosts, <br> our fathers God and ours! <br> Be with us in the future years; <br> and if the tempest lowers, <br> Look through the cloud with light of love, <br> and smile our tears away <br> And lead us through the brightening years <br> to Heavens eternal day. <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>5046</p>
