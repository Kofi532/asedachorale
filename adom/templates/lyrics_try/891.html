        <p><br>1 King of the city splendid, <br> Eternal in the height, <br> May all our country's cities <br> Be holy in Thy sight: <br> Cleansed from the deeds of darkness <br> Cities of light. <br> <br>2 Inspire the sons of labour, <br> That honest toil may be <br> Their token, in life's hardness, <br> Of loyalty to Thee. <br> That Thou mayst in their hand-work <br> Love's heart-work see. <br> <br>3 Teach love to gladden children <br> Who know not childhood's mirth, <br> Wronged of their rights no beauty <br> In their scant reach of earth: <br> To hope's large sunshine give them <br> A second birth. <br> <br>4 Lord, end the spell of passion, <br> Break Thou the drunkard's lure: <br> Thou art the one Physician <br> The human heart to cure; <br> The wavering will to strengthen, <br> Foul life make pure. <br> <br>5 Soon may our country's cities <br> Thy robe of glory wear: <br> Each place of toil a temple, <br> Each house a home of prayer: <br> Each city's name of beauty <br> The Lord is There! <br>  <br> Source: Methodist Hymn and Tune Book: official hymn book of the Methodist Church #<br>415</p>
