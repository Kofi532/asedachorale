        <p><br>1 Eternal Ruler of the ceaseless round <br> of circling planets singing on their way; <br> guide of the nations from the night profound <br> into the glory of the perfect day; <br> rule in our hearts, that we may ever be <br> guided and strengthened and upheld by thee.<br>2 We are of thee, the children of thy love, <br> the brothers of thy well-belov√®d Son; <br> descend, O Holy Spirit, like a dove, <br> into our hearts, that we may be as one: <br> as one with thee, to whom we ever tend; <br> as one with him, our Brother and our Friend.<br>3 We would be one in hatred of all wrong, <br> one in our love of all things sweet and fair, <br> one with the joy that breaketh into song, <br> one with the grief that trembles into prayer, <br> one in the power that makes thy children free <br> to follow truth, and thus to follow thee.<br>4 O clothe us with thy heavenly armour, Lord, <br> thy trusty shield, thy sword of love divine; <br> our inspiration be thy constant word; <br> we ask no victories that are not thine: <br> give or withhold, let pain or pleasure be; <br> enough to know that we are serving thee. <br>  <br> Source: Ancient and Modern: hymns and songs for refreshing worship #<br>244</p>
