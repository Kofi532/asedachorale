        <p><br>1 Land of our birth, we pledge to thee <br> Our love and toil in the years to be; <br> When we are grown and take our place <br> As men and women with our race. <br> <br>2 Father in Heavn, who lovest all, <br> O help Thy children when they call; <br> That they may build from age to age <br> An undefilèd heritage! <br> <br>3 Teach us to bear the yoke in youth, <br> With steadfastness and careful truth; <br> That, in our time, Thy grace may give <br> The truth whereby the nations live. <br> <br>4 Teach us to rule ourselves alway, <br> Controlled and cleanly night and day, <br> That we may bring, if need arise, <br> No maimed or worthless sacrifice. <br> <br>5 Teach us to look in all our ends, <br> On Thee for judge, and not our friends, <br> That we, with Thee, may walk uncowed <br> By fear or favor of the crowd. <br> <br>6 Teach us the strength that cannot seek, <br> By deed or thought, to hurt the weak, <br> That, under Thee, we may possess <br> Mans strength to comfort mans distress. <br> <br>7 Teach us delight in simple things, <br> And mirth that has no bitter springs, <br> Forgiveness free of evil done, <br> And love to all men neath the sun! <br> <br>8 Land of our birth, our faith, our pride, <br> For whose dear sake our fathers died; <br> O motherland, we pledge to thee <br> Head, heart and hand through the years to be! <br>  <br> Source: The Cyber Hymnal #<br>12701</p>
