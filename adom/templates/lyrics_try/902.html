        <p><br>1 All glory to God in the sky, <br> And peace upon earth be restored; <br> O Jesus, exalted on high, <br> Appear, our omnipotent Lord! <br> Who, meanly in Bethlehem born, <br> Didst stoop to redeem a lost race: <br> Once more to thy creatures return, <br> And reign in thy kingdom of grace. <br> <br>2 Oh, wouldst thou again be made known,-- <br> Again in thy Spirit descend; <br> And set up, in each of thine own, <br> A kingdom that never shall end! <br> Thou only art able to bless, <br> And make the glad nations obey, <br> And bid the dire enmity cease, <br> And bow the whole world to thy sway. <br> <br>3 Oh, come to thy servants again, <br> Who long thine appearing to know,-- <br> Thy quiet and peaceable reign <br> In mercy establish below: <br> All sorrow before thee shall fly, <br> And anger and hatred be o'er; <br> And envy and malice shall die, <br> And discord afflict us no more. <br> <br>4 No horrid alarum of war <br> Shall break our eternal repose; <br> No sound of the trumpet is there <br> Where Jesus' spirit o'erflows: <br> Appeased by the charms of thy grace, <br> We all shall in amity join; <br> And kindly each other embrace, <br> And love with a passion like thine. <br>  <br> Source: The Voice of Praise: a collection of hymns for the use of the Methodist Church #<br>226</p>
