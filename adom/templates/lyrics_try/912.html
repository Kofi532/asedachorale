        <p><br>1 Turn back, O mortal, quit thy foolish ways. <br> Old now is earth, and none may count her days, <br> Yet thou, its child, whose head is crowned with flame <br> Still wilt not hear thine inner God proclaim, <br> "Turn back, O mortal, quit thy foolish ways." <br> <br>2 Earth might be fair, and people glad and wise. <br> Age after age their tragic empires rise, <br> Built while they dream, and in that dreaming weep. <br> Would they but wake from out their haunted sleep, <br> Earth shall be fair, and people glad and wise. <br> <br>3 Earth shall be fair, and all its people one, <br> Nor till that hour shall God's whole will be done! <br> Now, even now, once more from earth to sky <br> Peals forth in joy the old, undaunted cry, <br> "Earth shall be fair, and all its people one." <br>  <br> Source: Worship in Song: A Friends Hymnal #<br>194</p>
