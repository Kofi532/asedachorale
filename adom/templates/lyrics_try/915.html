        <p><br>1 Father, Who art alone <br> Our helper and our stay, <br> Oh, hear us as we plead <br> For loved ones far away, <br> And shield with thine almighty hand, <br> And shield with Thine almighty hand <br> Our travelers by sea and land. <br> <br>2 For Thou, our Father God, <br> Art present everywhere, <br> And bendest low Thine ear <br> To catch the faintest pray'r, <br> Waiting rich blessings to bestow, <br> Waiting rich blessings to bestow <br> On all Thy children here below. <br> <br>3 Oh, compass with Thy love <br> The daily path they tread; <br> And may Thy light and truth <br> Upon their hearts be shed, <br> That, one in all things with Thy will, <br> That, one in all things with Thy will, <br> Heavns peace and joy their souls may fill. <br> <br>4 Guard them from every harm <br> When dangers shall assail, <br> And teach them that Thy pow'r <br> Can never, never fail; <br> We cannot with our loved ones be, <br> We cannot with our loved ones be, <br> But trust them, Father, unto Thee. <br> <br>5 We all are travelers here <br> Along life's various road, <br> Meeting and parting oft <br> Till we shall mount to God, <br> At home at last with those we love, <br> At home at last, with those we love, <br> Within Thy heav'nly home above. <br>  <br> Source: The Christian Hymnary.
