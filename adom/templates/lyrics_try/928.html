        <p><br>1 Morning comes with light all-cheering, <br> Shades of night have fled apace; <br> Source of light, by Thine appearing, <br> From our minds all darkness chase: <br> Thou hast blest us in our sleep; <br> Through the day direct and keep. <br> <br>2 Earth refreshed Thy praise is sounding, <br> all thy works Thy glory sing; <br> May our hearts, with love abounding, <br> Gratefully their tribute bring: <br> Thou hast taught the birds their lays; <br> Teach our hearts to sing Thy praise. <br> <br>3 All day long to praise Thee help us, <br> And to strive against all sin; <br> Finding all our help in Jesus, <br> Who for us the fight did win: <br> He was tempted here below, <br> And doth all our weakness know. <br> <br>4 Man goes to his work till evening <br> Brings again the needed rest; <br> Grant that we, Thy grace receiving, <br> May in all we do be blest: <br> And wherever we may be <br> Find our joy in pleasing Thee. <br> Amen. <br>  <br>  <br> Source: The Methodist Hymn-Book with Tunes #<br>928</p>
