        <p><br>1 O Splendor of God's glory bright, <br> O Thou that bringest light from light, <br> O Light of Light, light's living spring, <br> O Day, all days illumining: <br> Alleluia! <br> <br>2 Come, very Sun of truth and love; <br> Pour down Thy radiance from above <br> And shed the Holy Spirit's ray <br> On all we think or do or say. <br> Alleluia! <br> <br>3 With prayer the Father we implore: <br> O Father, glorious evermore, <br> We plead with Thee for grace and pow'r <br> To conquer in temptation's hour, <br> Alleluia! <br> <br>4 To guide whate'er we nobly do, <br> With love all envy to subdue, <br> To give us grace our wrongs to bear, <br> To make ill fortune turn to fair. <br> Alleluia! <br> <br>5 On Christ, the true bread, let us feed; <br> Let Him to us be drink indeed; <br> And let us taste with joyfulness <br> The Holy Spirit's plenteousness. <br> Alleluia! <br> <br>6 All laud to God the Father be; <br> All praise, eternal Son, to Thee; <br> All glory to the Spirit raise <br> In equal and unending praise. <br> Alleluia! <br>  <br>  <br> Source: Lutheran Service Book #<br>874</p>
