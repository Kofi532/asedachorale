        <p><br>1 At thy feet, O Christ, we lay <br> thine own gift of this new day; <br> doubt of what it holds in store <br> makes us crave thine aid the more; <br> lest it prove a time of loss, <br> mark it, Saviour, with thy cross. <br> <br>2 If it flow on calm and bright, <br> be thyself our chief delight: <br> if it bring unknown distress, <br> good is all that thou canst bless; <br> only, while its hours begin, <br> pray we, keep them clear of sin. <br> <br>3 We in part our weakness know, <br> and in part discern our foe; <br> well for us, before thine eyes <br> all our danger open lies; <br> turn not from us, while we plead <br> thy compassions and our need. <br> <br>4 Fain would we thy word embrace, <br> live each moment on thy grace, <br> all our selves to thee consign, <br> fold up all our wills in thine, <br> think and speak and do and be <br> simply that which pleases thee. <br> <br>5 Hear us, Lord, and that right soon; <br> hear, and grant the choicest boon <br> that thy love can eÂ’er impart, <br> loyal singleness of heart: <br> do shall this and all our days, <br> Christ our God, show forth thy praise. <br>  <br> Source: CPWI Hymnal #<br>1</p>
