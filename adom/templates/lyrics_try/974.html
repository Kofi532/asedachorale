<p>God of the living, in whose eyes <br/> Unveiled thy whole creation lies, <br/> All souls are thine; we must not say <br/> That those are dead who pass away, <br/> From this our world of flesh set free; <br/> We know them living unto thee. <br/> Released from earthly toil and strife, <br/> With thee is hidden still their life; <br/> Thine are their thoughts, their works, their powers, <br/> All thine, and yet most truly ours, <br/> For well we know, where'er they be, <br/> Our dead are living unto thee. <br/> Not spilt like water on the ground, <br/> Not wrapped in dreamless sleep profound, <br/> Not wandering in unknown despair <br/> Beyond thy voice, thine arm, thy care; <br/> Not left to lie like fallen tree; <br/> Not dead, but living unto thee. <br/> Thy word is true, thy will is just; <br/> To thee we leave them, Lord, in trust; <br/> And bless thee for the love which gave <br/> Thy Son to fill a human grave, <br/> That none might fear that world to see <br/> Where all are living unto thee. <br/> <br/>374 <br/> O Breather into man of breath, <br/> O Holder of the keys of death, <br/> O Giver of the life within, <br/> Save us from death, the death of sin; <br/> That body, soul, and spirit be <br/> For ever living unto thee! <br/> Amen.</p>
