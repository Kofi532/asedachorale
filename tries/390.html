        <h1>1 Give me the faith which can remove
and sink the mountain to a plain;
give me the childlike praying love,
which longs to build thy house again;
thy love, let it my heart o'er-power,
and all my simple soul devour.
2 I would the precious time redeem,
and longer live for this alone,
to spend and to be spent for them
who have not yet my Saviour known;
fully on these my mission prove,
and only breathe, to breathe thy love.
3 My talents, gifts and graces, Lord,
into thy blessed hands receive,
and let me live to preach thy word,
and let me to thy glory live;
my every sacred moment spend
in publishing the sinner's Friend.
4 Enlarge, inflame and fill my heart
with boundless charity divine,
so shall I all my strength exert,
and love them with a zeal like thine,
and lead them to thy open side,
the sheep for whom the Shepherd died.
